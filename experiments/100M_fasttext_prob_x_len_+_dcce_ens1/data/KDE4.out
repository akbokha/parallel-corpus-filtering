the module website can be compiled in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list .
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated as part of the entire URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the web can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ page , where you can directly insert translation texts . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
further information about the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of default setting modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Cancel . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of crashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the View Filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ ative element , all other verti@@ ces are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the &amp; FS@@ View module ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; displays a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures .
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the items in it . accordingly , large files , even then can easily be detected if it is located far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , it can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the tre@@ emap is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view mode can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of lower rect@@ angles is to be used ( whereby therefore display errors occur due to restrictions on the sign of the tre@@ ad ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; when reporting algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be comp@@ lied with that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; as distribution of the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains up to the implementation . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum represented area for an entry above the menu entry View . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually covered by an associated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Gallery ... or with Ctr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call up the module image gallery , a dialog opens to which you can set the look of the gallery . &quot;
the option Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a screen@@ play to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
specify the fil@@ ename of the image to display the fil@@ en@@ ames under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; to view the image size of the image , see whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you determine whether the size of the images is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub @-@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the Sub@@ folder intersection , you can set a slider or a turn field to which level the sub @-@ folders are included . &quot;
copy the original pictures to copy the original pictures to the gallery .
using the comment box comment file you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML @-@ Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be viewed in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu on the navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane and drag the music files you want to hear in media playback . &quot;
&quot; browsing the browser add a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser feature of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; changes to M@@ SIE for pages that decline access with browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SIE browsers to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;

&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras can be downloaded by using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; you can use it to view , comment , review and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded using K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( Manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more metadata , such as the camera or the lens that can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities . &quot;
&quot; if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to answer questions other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , we would like to answer questions of other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ kam . homepage to learn news about released versions and other digi@@ tization ; to learn .
the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ kam is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; when you launch &amp; Edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter path names or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k will be saved . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a collection of pictures on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; dur@@ es recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude a sub@@ folder , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to paste an item before the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list don &apos;t have any photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and use it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Documents to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help shell support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; more than 1000 digital cameras can be downloaded by using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ 2 is a free , further distributed software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association , allowing the transmission of images from digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably display the digi@@ ti@@ sed thumb@@ nails . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , preview images may not be possible or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to digi@@ kam is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; ti@@ pi modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the settings for the ki@@ pi modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam , by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were made in &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works anywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , over the horizontal divi@@ ding line or to another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not able to place in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Films and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this blind spot is displayed . what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the alarm settings . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; Edit are stored in a single album . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first , the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it there . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to give information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with viewing albums sorted by date .
&quot; first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file will be used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the &quot; &quot; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; drop@@ down menu &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying heads in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this allows you to avoid using all preview images in the Tools menu . &quot;
information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is you can edit through Settings . select the albums page and customize the area preview images to your preferences .
the screen shot at the top of the Intro@@ duction section in the main window displays such a help window .
&quot; the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can view all the functions that have been digi@@ ti@@ sed or edited . you can view all the functions that have been digi@@ ti@@ sed or edited . you can choose between viewing the pictures , slideshow or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by choosing either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button , and edit ... Select your photos and edit them . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by drag@@ ging the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to do so , and how to customize the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est option is to right click on the preview and rotate it . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , right click on the preview and selecting F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move F@@ 8 image dele@@ tion or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ eline sli@@ p@@ quot ; organi@@ zes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam , use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date leaf@@ let below in the calendar view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are labels that can be assigned to individual photos or groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords in a logical way . you can also fold part of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch@@ word ; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the keyword of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the attributes of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit keyword in the contex@@ tual menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to make use of functionality with keywords , you must first select your photos with keywords . alternatively , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . in this way you can choose a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the keywords menu . the menu only displays the keywords that have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . to select a time@@ frame , you just need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . this will display all the corresponding pictures in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the filter will be cleared and all pictures will be displayed . if the search has not found , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it , you get a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , hit the head OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the View list in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit search , the search will appear again with the search information . if you choose to edit as an advanced search , you will find more rules to search for . further information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search options , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . each option can be added to the search group or delete it . each option can be added to this list by means of the logical operations All ... , One ... , None ... or at least ... &quot;
&quot; this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the less the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar . if you move a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ kam . find the right pictures . also here a threshold can be set .
&quot; this tab represents an intuitive map search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . &quot;
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o @-@ folder .
&quot; it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em Shin@@ ing Table Add from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview toolbar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate through pairs from the toolbar , then use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right panel . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the illuminated table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold down the screen . in the mode preview both images will show the same image area . &quot;
zo@@ oming works exactly like in other views . simply use the zoom slider under the images or Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out . this happens in both images when you preview the mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - away from the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ ans or digital photos takes a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , find , protect and use photos again . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , categ@@ or@@ ised , categ@@ or@@ ised , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , and exports content that sub@@ lime or cultural value .@@ quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to locate and digi@@ kam . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , you will certainly not use it &amp; digi@@ kam . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use it &amp; digi@@ kam . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use it &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures may be found quickly over your location unless you were in a year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re @-@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend storing metadata in the Edit page of metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget it , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do this , digi@@ kam it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute , and then set the value . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you often hot in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
when you import catalog@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords then it will be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically re@@ build the tree for you res@@ uming the images to another . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while tracking the sub@@ trees .
&quot; this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tool to catalogue your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you just want to let anyone know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from a distance is not even a beautiful beach view . if you look closer , start to see some details , people , the square . &quot;
&quot; wow ! one starts to dream of having associations , memories , the historic period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; if you export your images to web galleries , you can export it for a selection of images at the same time . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will be more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel by using images with ge@@ ographic data . &quot;
&quot; Copy@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam it should be stored as information :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the photographer is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the image is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate errors , disk failure , power viol@@ ability , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . this type of loss is the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems in the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious treats must be handled and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good recording devices and they can store them in the right way . the best DVD recording equipment is not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we use to protect itself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control tot@@ als . in spite of this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is an inexpensive program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software , which can read this media . &quot;
&quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturers offer a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors are the most common cause of error , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors are the most common cause of error . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also save data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage . &quot;
&quot; the most widely used protection against power tips is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of any cable to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for lap@@ tops , and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of just a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically supply battery energy when a power failure occurs . &quot;
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity disturb@@ ances with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you think how well your computer is protected .
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost and dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost and dollar ; 500 . additionally you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more , in case of fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be verified in reality first . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst part is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of bugs per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ stations . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of ste@@ aling is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the major causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . what is meant is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive is now available for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous such as rein@@ st@@ alling your operating system , replacing plates or resi@@ zing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA device every day . if , then one day , a flash will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft crash : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; hence , di@@ aster@@ oid prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common cause of data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential security .
incre@@ mental Backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh . &quot;
backup key images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , playback of images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood and adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate all that is going on . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with planned and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . on * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
&quot; with the d@@ mes@@ g command , check if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modi@@ fies the size of res@@ ize if necessary
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG can save gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved colour allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression . this format we want to recommend to you to save your images . &quot;
&quot; TIFF has been widely distributed as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; the Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a liz@@ enz @-@ free and open source image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a hand@@ ful camera display is already available , and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon may use it some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored by extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits , since it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include the work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a subtle editing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures once more , edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were then cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your data base . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , to use it , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , a he@@ el indicator appears at the bottom of the camera and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and the thumb@@ nails for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information for each entry . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
&quot; this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos to your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and select Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports it , an option New downloaded is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are selected with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you download the buttons all or select Sel@@ ected ones , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and click OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and digi@@ kam it will load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you only want to delete some , then you have to select them first and delete Sel@@ ected Sel@@ ected Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , the photos are not moved to the sleeves of &amp; k@@ de ; so you should carefully check whether the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . so , if you want to delete the camera , you should check this over the camera &apos;s menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos from different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created a day . &quot;
&quot; the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard Auto Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , you will be able to correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ ename , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in capital letters when you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , which has been digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; all the information about the orientation of the camera can be used to start recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Side@@ bar , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; all pictures with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam . if you want to change it , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the option dates based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . select then upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
select the folder you want and click OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in length and width incre@@ ments and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O , or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to mapping an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forget where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the latitude and long@@ itude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ if@@ Tools by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre@@ text beha@@ ved coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to change in the Edit menu . you can change between them by clicking on the Edit icons on the left . &quot;
select Action can be displayed on a set preview or start editing . you &apos;ll set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as is shown below , the identification and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected from the camera &apos;s interface . even in a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; this must not be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . thus , the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digi@@ ti@@ zed data base ; these metadata also have other programs available and can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; they can be imported without losing . &quot;
&quot; save image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the ann@@ ot@@ ations embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list and remove any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam . any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that none of these extensions will have , has been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; ignored . &quot;
default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , if you have one , you can only use them on fast computers . if you have one then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar when you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . &quot;
&quot; using the TIFF files option , you can un@@ comp@@ ress the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm is loss@@ less . &quot;
&quot; even if you select the loss @-@ loss setting , the ratio between loss of quality and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . at present , it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , you eliminate this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image slightly soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is it the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the sh@@ it@@ ters , as it displays the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ els in various ro@@ ses . finally , you can try to re@@ produce some parts of the missing information from the highlights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the non @-@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the re@@ construc@@ ting option , you will have the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it a little higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the demo effect small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; one dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particle data , which have many cameras and which have a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction . &quot;
&quot; V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a colour change correction , since it is carried out during the conversion conversion . &quot;
a profile translat@@ es the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the colour information from one colour space to be translated into the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
conduct questions when an image is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; create color profile folders here , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you can store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of the ICC @-@ Profile You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera creator and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma isn &apos;t corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to change the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be reproduced by a device . this is very useful before you print the picture , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could be corrected manually , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not among the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by delivering this interface , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the ki@@ pi interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the ki@@ pi modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about ki@@ pi modules can be obtained from the ki@@ pi project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the ki@@ pi modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ating adjust the time between the picture transi@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; the camera features on the left are a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be activated if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , to use it , you need to connect the camera to your computer , put it in the display mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; check whether &amp; Edit ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them here . &quot;
with the option Con@@ fir@@ mation dialog for drag@@ ging images into the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
&quot; editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ kl@@ ed by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the splash screen of &amp; digi@@ kam . in certain circumstances , this acceler@@ ates the start process of digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; when something from the base folder has been deleted , asked &amp; Edit ; you can delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the View / Edit entry .
picture editing contains a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the ki@@ pi modules in the section editing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ ename , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you save the file Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or Rest@@ ore the button Rest@@ ore image processing in the toolbar . you will then lose every change you have done on the photo since last memory . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be und@@ one or recovered . you can undo the last action by modi@@ fying , res@@ uming , and re@@ producing from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should remember the short@@ cuts , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ produce . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the back button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by drag@@ ging the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in the press Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the menu menu .
to customize a photo to the window size you can use this button in toolbar : magni@@ fication factor automatically
&quot; view full screen mode shows the image in full screen mode . you get into the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c key . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can choose to print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases . complete picture preview can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu Ex@@ por@@ ting Print Assistant . if you follow the wi@@ zard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ master ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation file , even in image editing . it will appear when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can use other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters will be re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata adjustment that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to select multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword image shows a search box for filtering the keywords , keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords for a series of pictures . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword image , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not on the whole selection . if you want to add a keyword , please refer to the keyword keyword . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar stit@@ ch filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . in addition , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if in addition one or more stit@@ ches are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all displayed keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop Key@@ words . suppose you have selected several images in the main panel to provide you with keywords . if the keyword exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched on Settings Other .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or its , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string which is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ based workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are identical to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web that match your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on colour management . unfortunately , color management means you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . unfortunately , color management means you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your educational workflow meets all the criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
&quot; your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; if so s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color fo@@ ams , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; the c@@ alli@@ br@@ ation of your monitor closes the circle . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alizing , Com@@ par@@ ison , Auto Com@@ par@@ ison and Con@@ tr@@ ast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; at times , the same amount of pixels makes the same number of pixels . sometimes the same number of pixels makes the same number of pixels . &quot;
&quot; automatic synchron@@ ization : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ cation of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is something limited because of a color space of 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can use the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithms protected by P@@ aw@@ el T. J@@ och@@ n@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; in the upper right corner a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . with a button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or down the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat using the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons store and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance you set can save you to a text file and load it later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences Button once again reset all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw pictures . it uses the change and the allocation of color profiles . colour mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu of Color Precision Cor@@ rection . this tool provides an integrated path to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you always need the same error . in the manual for the correction of the sample , you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ zing effect is provided by four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar pol@@ ari@@ zation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that arose when one partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash light and subsequently revers@@ ed the development of the picture . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the extra light . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar pol@@ ari@@ zation . at approx . 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ apers .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos . &quot;
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photo using the tools in the menu . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to increase satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the mold correction is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog becomes very complicated for this tool , you need only the area of the slider for the application described here . more specific the three slider below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ ene of the intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three slide gates are cli@@ cked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and watch how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic arrangement is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , resources and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this sel@@ ector allows to specify the channel modi@@ fying the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most useful . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you shift a curve part to the right , e.g. the light tones , then you can see that these light tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that the corresponding pixels will become dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect in the final result . &quot;
underneath you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance duct . shadow and sun shades have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the image processing .
with the Channel Selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , as the channel mixer then is the tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when mixing Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . &quot;
save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save and load any Mixer setting for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating about your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film bars . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford Ev@@ ans FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter .
&quot; orange filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
rot@@ ator : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can sim@@ ulate moon shafts during the time of the day . similar to the 003 co@@ h@@ kin ( t@@ m ) rotor .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow liner filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 co@@ h@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ ia : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the appearance of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ harv@@ ite . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother , and thus similar to the 005 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) sep@@ ta filter . &quot;
using &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ master ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired type of frame for your picture . the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce cuts it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any point . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; every setting chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the digi@@ master ; apply tool sten@@ cil you can put a template over a picture .
using the Picture Template to apply in the image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add your template to the digi@@ master ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template of the templates . &quot;
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it in the desired position . &quot;
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image will then be adapted automatically to thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other fields .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the shar@@ p@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera has often been used internal focus . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a depth of field while reading the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t Archi@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; you should handle it carefully , since the results are not very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . generally , you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much simpler than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to shar@@ pen soft marks with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ter and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a gun are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow for larger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red picture to be added to the original . thus the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are exemp@@ ted from shar@@ p@@ ness and hence beauty defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
this &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Film . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a shar@@ p@@ ness mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing on colors in image editing .
&quot; in practice , circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; s circuit . &quot;
&quot; circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ness effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; if you use a value equal to zero , you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focuss@@ ed parameter you have placed will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , but later left unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , and eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ shar@@ ply Mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by making the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the Un@@ ity mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often at least as good as the Un@@ ity mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of focuss@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regulator smooth@@ es the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink tin@@ te allows for a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoothing and Advanced Settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ting or CCD scrat@@ ches , a high value wave @-@ like patterns are generated . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best fixed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ it@@ . p then defines relative smoothing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . &quot;
&quot; integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the quality that you receive by choosing this option is only small . it dou@@ bles the duration . we therefore recommend it to release it .
the buttons store and load exactly this . correct any hi@@ ring of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; error correction is compar@@ atively very fast to work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button . &quot;
below you can see how to remove image errors with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreg@@ round that caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the digi@@ kam , noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert . &quot;
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read these in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be removed successfully with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases only the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with default settings .
&quot; a radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the tolerance value of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more obsc@@ ure , but also mer@@ ges the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls adjusting the phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smooth , if it is too high , the edges appear to be removed . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
store and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to shar@@ pen soft marks with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ter and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ kam . photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filtering gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film bas@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a lossy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons store and load exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast to work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Be@@ ad button . &quot;
below you can see how a photo with uni@@ formity reduction will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera was recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film bas@@ tion on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and that corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo created using a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark@@ brown sub@@ traction method , there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wi@@ zard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark picture directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wi@@ zard shows the last dark image and automatically charges it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of neighboring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block are used to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filtering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are pulled up to inter@@ pol@@ ate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ rupt the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ rupt the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ kam , Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , particularly those in medium and large photo format , can often light the entire sensor range not ev@@ enly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; instead &amp; quot ;
&quot; but it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise infin@@ ity effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and colour chart of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a center filter by using a center filter that is done without this filter . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
with three controllers you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light gain absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compensate for a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction decreases the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
if you want a more fine re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image then let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu . image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a correction and contrast correction was also carried out in the image using this tool .
the digi@@ kam is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second graph treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the picture .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar conc@@ entri@@ c effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth density correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally : this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ dient . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of p@@ inc@@ us@@ hion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth density . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters contain the reverse mark of the parameter in general . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus results in correc@@ ting first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , the dialog with a preview illustr@@ ates the distortion . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
the ton@@ n@@ - or p@@ inc@@ us@@ hion correction should be done before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as all first . if you cut a picture new and then perform a ton@@ ne correction the effect would seem obvious to the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to fix the dotted lines . in the connection , you can correct the cone / p@@ inc@@ us@@ hion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a p@@ inc@@ us@@ hion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trans@@ forming tool from the image editing or through the zoom slider on this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as shots from front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ularity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add film bas@@ ins when you want to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
&quot; since the filter mixed color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , since the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared film fir@@ mer applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the highlights .
&quot; this is known by classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the producers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film selection effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ master ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ master ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regulator to influence this effect . the upper el@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush is better for large images . smoothing controls the smoothing or , from the other side , the char@@ isma . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the image is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size image is 1 and Smo@@ ät@@ te 17 .
images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen yourself to sket@@ ch . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ master ; filter engraving defines your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ master ; filter engraving is a quick tool to give your pictures back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important to the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ious landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted with another version of stain@@ ed blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Be@@ ad button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of infin@@ ity effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ cre@@ ase : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ om@@ ous camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sport photography .
radi@@ al shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ red motion : bl@@ urs the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur@@ red of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing camera from a car or train . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ red shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by a random shift of the pixels , thereby sim@@ ulating the shar@@ p@@ ness of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera . &quot;
intelligent ag@@ ility : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the Be@@ ad button at any time .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps to your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . because the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the image .
&quot; you can use the Edit button ; editing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . to do this , use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter drops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ating or Trans@@ forming Mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image if the limitations of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool for size modi@@ fies a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ inters inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the Tab@@ s New Size and are listed below :
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons store as and store are used exactly to do this . to enlarge each thumb@@ nail for photo can be saved as a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast in what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Be@@ ad button . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear default magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you need to use the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , then you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The Cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the Preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by drag@@ ging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the width of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected relation and orientation . &quot;
the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image .
&quot; the settings of the cooperation help allow you to blend in , so that you can get your images together better . these help are : &quot;
harmonious triangle : harmonious divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden mean : the golden mean is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sel or the glass@@ works of a sun@@ flower . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the figure deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden mean provides liquid resource lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . in comparison to the third @-@ level rule , the golden spir@@ als create a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river on this type . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rect@@ angles . &quot;
the Golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles .
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of dynamic symmet@@ ry of professional photographers . try to place your ima@@ gery at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al Mir@@ rors and Ver@@ tical Mir@@ rors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it is easy to hold the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angular . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider to 0 degrees again . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the module Free rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to position the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ formed cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally cut the function . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . notice however the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left at the bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a little lubri@@ cated . for individual adjustment , this effect is small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you adjusted the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to shift part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . in other words , a right angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; drag your image by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al An@@ gle and Ver@@ tical An@@ gle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped a little . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two sho@@ cks generate twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing .
&quot; it needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system but you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath .
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , it will be edited . if the extension is listed in the list , it will be edited and edited . in the section configuration section you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can download raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the section configuration , you will find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats created by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
many digital cameras support shooting short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format .
go forward to the previously visited record in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone before .
synchron@@ ize the metadata between the database and all the files of the current main window . the images replace the database &apos;s metadata and no other way around like this menu .
&quot; menu entry of the ti@@ pi module for manual , automatic turning / reflect the current image based on the orientation in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; sorted all pictures in the current album according to their name , path , date , file size or their rating . &quot;
the metadata bank will be over@@ written by the data of the files for deviations . the other variant can be started from the menu album .
all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please see the camera section for more information .
ki@@ pi @-@ Module exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&quot; if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white balance . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; use a unified dialogue type , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image .
vertical share without dup@@ licate . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected field .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area . &quot;
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are marked .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . this data comes from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab represents an intuitive map search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets which are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the palette loaded , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets , or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the palette view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box At the cursor is selected below the button color , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the clip@@ board , you can use it as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colours in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&quot; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ Graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graphics &amp; graphics ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ ima@@ vi@@ z ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is new and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these knot@@ s )
&quot; more needed software : &amp; k@@ ph ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool and dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . needed are needed in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ window . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more and dot , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the downloaded file has been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in a file browser or command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ screen ; instance , or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this can also be changed with the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . once again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are on a page , are to be fitted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph@@ s distributed across several pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; page Er@@ ne@@ ut shop gives you the option to set behavior when a file has been changed to disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or en@@ qu@@ ire the program each time . &quot;
the page Open gives the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ screen ; set when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time it is asked .
the session management page gives the ability to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or to be asked at any start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among various &amp; graphical ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ executed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; fd@@ p ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce spring model for un@@ executed graph@@ s . it uses the fru@@ gal pure gold he@@ ur@@ istic and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for treating large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ mann and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should be able to accept the graph file as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify special options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( judged or executed ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ executed graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI button with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ ph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graphical tools to display . it needs the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; check@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find further options .
&quot; the main window of the Symbol Editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; when the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . &quot;

the ki@@ pi module reading images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . at present two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the S@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog will appear that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ oth to select your image accordingly . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings might otherwise not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; once you have cli@@ cked the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the image file &apos;s options . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
&quot; you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the menu &quot; &quot; Im@@ por@@ ting &quot; &quot; &gt; screen shot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots : &quot;
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other desktop , you should select this delay up enough to have the time to navigate to . &quot;
after the screen@@ shot has been made the dialog will appear options of the target image with the options already described above .

&quot; the ti@@ pi module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alisation provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , longitudinal and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and select the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . in order to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alisation , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation from below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have track data from a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these boundaries here and then press the button cor@@ rel@@ ate for inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have set a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog shows the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be selected and set with the displayed map . select the region in question , and enlarge it . select the region in question and enlarge it . the map can be selected manually between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the ki@@ pi @-@ module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a html page image gallery to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding for the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be changed . the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you can quickly select these albums . the albums will not appear hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will appear the al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
&quot; the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image will be displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed . &quot;
the tab speci@@ fies the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated pictures . choose a folder where you have typ@@ ing permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Rider for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program entries to see if errors occurred during production . &quot;
the Des@@ pi Image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL tool for viewing pictures .
&quot; the ki@@ pi image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a wind@@ owed mode . &quot;
the Des@@ pi JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in PNG format . &quot;
the Ki@@ pi Module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the ki@@ pi Module digital camera client currently does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the ki@@ pi team mailing list below k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the ki@@ pi @-@ module Metad@@ ata Editor does not have any documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list to the ki@@ pi team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the ki@@ pi MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length . this module also uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to use the DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can use this module to use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that you can start the module via Tools MPEG slideshow .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sort of images or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that displays a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image changes . &quot;
the background color can be set up next . in doubt you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG file file .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start drinking coffee quickly , or in any rest , and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic will appear that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick par@@ c@@ els using the button Settings right below . &quot;
the printer wi@@ zard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image image Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
&quot; this ki@@ pi module allows you to import or convert your images stored in RAW files in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : don &apos;t you expect the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
first select the RAW file which is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image File Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or use them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the raw file will be saved in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Start button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sing . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 dim . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional in size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
this ki@@ pi module allows you to send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent beforehand .
&quot; after you start the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you select . click on the images to add more images to a file selection dialog . for the selected image you will see a preview on the right . &quot;
you can drag images to the picture list and place it there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the button remove images the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the button OK . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachment .
take care not to send too many pictures at a time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu .
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after choosing comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the File Format File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats , such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ i@@ fers will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically close so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions such as your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL cap@@ tions in the presentation will use Open@@ GL &apos;s very elegant image transi@@ tions . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the File name option will show that the fil@@ ename of the images will be shown in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the check@@ box ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually exit with Es@@ c .
the option to choose pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; with delay between images , the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1,5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . random sel@@ ects a different effect at every transition between images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom left of the screen you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the ki@@ pi Module time &amp; date currently does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the ki@@ pi team mailing list below k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
the ki@@ pi Module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , thus in people , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you entered information when you have entered your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse over the entry , it changes the view of the browser . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both people can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button which is located on the right of the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to select the image for each individual person . to do so , you need to open the image viewer window ( see in detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you search the Find query in the main window , a dialog will appear to you , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string in the inscription or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date may be either a part of the overall date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s guide for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ aut@@ i album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start your photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry k@@ aut@@ i album ; you can then select the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date @-@ statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can see a part of a database between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show you the date shown in the preview image ) , and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the displayed images when you navigate in preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the time bar by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create via the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout , and target . in the following , each section is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page .
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you specified . thus , it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE @-@ supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to them . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ v file . you can import them to your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this file is an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL that you have provided when creating the HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting images is described , which you can access via the File View menu . &quot;
the main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; to copy Manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copying &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; as most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported data base as described in . &quot;
&quot; the Wi@@ zard to import is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a D@@ ane ) , while this category is assigned to your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the impor@@ ting file should be imported and what categories they comply with in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image . &quot;
&quot; you just have to be able to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to see images of your Italian vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your images , but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with the option -@@ c , as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu entry Pre@@ ferences c@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will find the various settings options .
&quot; on the left you can see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available that you can call up by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; it has been described how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group are set up in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called ti@@ pi and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu module . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications each other , it may be that the modules with a photo@@ album ; only very little have been tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules above ti@@ pi are very different , making it possible that some modules with and photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ aut@@ y@@ album ; and other applications , which also use ki@@ pi , is that the other applications don &apos;t support their pictures in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules order for albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ aut@@ i album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , use the category people , it will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you would have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the image you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start your photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu item and a toolbar . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to mark each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the image , where the image is recorded , etc . , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all of these ann@@ ot@@ ations can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments by using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by selecting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown on all 50 pictures , you can find the names to be moved up and assign them faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located below the preview of the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the Not@@ ation dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and drop it to a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and drag@@ ging the bars , forming the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window by drag@@ ging it outside the window pane . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... that offers you the possibility to store the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to get this window back later , use the Options button ... and then window on / off . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for example , see here . you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and select either the Del@@ ete key or select Edit selection from the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images without saving you to the hard drive . of course , you need to record the images anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the images anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard drive . for example , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance like the m@@ ess of your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the images so that at the end you can block those images that you can see for others and click Current View . &quot;
&quot; you have specified which images should be hidden in case of the case . if you want to give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so that all the pictures you have locked will be hidden . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other , anyone can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . it of course shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag them and drop it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed . all of these options are available after right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow , and then press a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing Ctr@@ l key and plus . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can drag it into the picture and zoom in . you can zoom in and zoom in the middle of the picture using the minus key . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the control key the zo@@ oms set , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are .
&quot; with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you view images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment , you can preview the image and open configuration dialog of the image to insert that name . you will probably prefer to mark the image and view more pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can launch the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by the other .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to apply images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you view categories in show preview , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the picture was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you allow you to paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in case you can see a picture on the painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the painting from the context menu . to exit the painting please press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Pa@@ ste menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can select the correct position : &quot;
&quot; delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting , either from the Edit menu or from the right mouse button context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed attributes , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will appear with a bug report . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the folder dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to be able to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; click Preview in the properties tab and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render only one part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging the mouse over the entire window . &quot;
each object has a visibility stage as the wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different configuration , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window or under an existing view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginning to a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map guide@@ books at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating ; you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can save you with view window allocation ... save . it will display a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can render it ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the render icon The render icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode is equivalent to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender @-@ modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name that makes sense but a name that lets you recognize the attributes of the mode .
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the intersection field and enter the image of the image for rendering into the input fields . &quot;
in the combination field quality you can select the properties called &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when displaying smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling gets the neighbouring pixel . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray each pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 pixels will be calculated by following a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that can be tra@@ cked individually and be checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this tab card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays do not hit any object . &quot;
opens a new window to display &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished you can find the reason here .
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the scene , select the import file ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full range of orders of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings appears a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; then write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply tick the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with Copy and Pa@@ ste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste Source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the properties view , click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; if you include files that are not in the folder of the library , you also need to enter the path to these files . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type number plate .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and spins . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detail for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided as the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick cann@@ on smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted . in more detail about the parameters you will find in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window assignments will explain how you can create and store window orders .
the combination field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views using the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with new column , create a new column on the right hand side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert sources of light , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu item Del@@ ete . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera has control points to change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you use the App@@ ly button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( In@@ ser@@ ted End@@ al Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size at x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the plane , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you view the object tree closely , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and moving . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to the drill a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment you select something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree ( name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matte black material , because you need to add adjustments to the pigment again . so , always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see color on header and ball in the preview , click App@@ ly on the App@@ ly button and then go to preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Solid Color . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the properties : &quot;
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic mode of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can just as easily be created as the ground :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the button or the App@@ ly button ) so that the ball has moved over the ground , as you moved the ground around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . take a suitable material in the following step . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; first select the item and change the name for example in the pigment pigment . click on the pigment , then select Solid Color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already results in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene of ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) affect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . thus , the scene is manipul@@ ated pixels for pixels . &quot;
&quot; without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene you want to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last given command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Re@@ ver@@ ts .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new configuration or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add commands pres@@ et with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands to change or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove commands with this option toolbar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ dict rough surfaces without having to model any bead on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
texture Map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application features a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files which you can use by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all the pictures should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; there are five cards in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be set . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .

&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning pictures that no longer makes scanning and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project site by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel reply &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start scanning a pre @-@ scan and then scan scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the entire preview fits into the window . &quot;
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be displayed . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; open images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog in front of each image scann@@ ed . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is beyond the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is recorded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE navigation dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

the global short@@ cuts can be set by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up a global keyboard short@@ cut ... Select . choose File &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click the right mouse button in the player window and set up short commands ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could look &amp; z@@ b ; look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use dialog for the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply add it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called rather easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default setting of the script . for this reason , scripts should over@@ see their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the configuration dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the desktop to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change Sign@@ aling that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ aling a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; to add an entry , you can use D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove an entry , you can use D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user and z@@ b have downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be optionally configured with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should properly name your script packages . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org click and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; you might have already some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; when the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . this will change the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; note voice files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of the corresponding music files . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
&quot; use other browsers : here , you can specify the path to another browser that is not listed in the list . &quot;
&quot; save play@@ lists when loading , saves the current playlist automatically when loading &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the storage location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the play@@ lists window to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
switching to context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn Writ@@ ings , the otherwise gray section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : select play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set a color scheme . use the color selection for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; start playing at the start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the play automatically continues with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is cli@@ cked , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using custom colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas will open the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn color is not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; in order to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the scann@@ ed and their sub@@ folders to search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . besides , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists will be added to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down box driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected yet another device in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l Device is necessary .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will the machine enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the map@@ .@@ f@@ m card draws the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can submit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
note : you can view the list in context @-@ browsers . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pre@@ dict that your window manager stops the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also add the broken file that causes the crash .
usually this is because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will result in crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . disable , if in@@ active for ... to setup the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens after a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects can be easily forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ X@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to modify the correct version first . &quot;
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are easiest by using an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for seeking help . please make a mistake there , if you find something on the fixing of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how do pieces of music come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window was converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the user &apos;s rating while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column show . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; tag . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the add button , the playlist is stored . click it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one by the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time , or by using the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in finding the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia sound system . activate Sound Server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause distor@@ ted playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia fully to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask for the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer , once as a system administrator and once again as your normal user . &quot;
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before bed . &quot;
how to get to know the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on a different computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa your@@ sel@@ name Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok windows . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of Ctr@@ l + right mouse button plays a piece in the click @-@ row order into the queu@@ e . pressing the button after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what does it look like with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; click on a browser &apos;s title . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .

&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser features three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpretation . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpretation . &quot;
&quot; if you already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the start window is dropped off . the information presented there is now stored in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , the information can be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras Statisti@@ cs ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . &quot;
&quot; you can find more information about the current piece under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation . &quot;
&quot; the pictures may have arbitr@@ ary names , but pictures with the word front in the name will be treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also show cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .

the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search for google.com with the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Performer - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are left out of the same . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing artist / album - first of all , the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and there will be another split after the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing artist / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related . &quot;

group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your songs are sorted first by genre and including interpreter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works as well as the above , but additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you have a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the toolbar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . references to using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
&quot; the search filter is a selection box , which allows you to filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can of course choose your entire collection , from the last 24 hours up to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you get the following options . &quot;

&quot; set up a compilation album - Chang@@ es a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that , the album will not be displayed anymore among different performers , but again under the associated interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the playlist browser makes handling of a lot of play@@ lists quite simple , including Smart Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click on the Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ windows will be used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.@@ g iPod ) . for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you &apos;ll need to locate the pieces on your iPod by performer sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z input and input keys , you can use music in the music / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dro@@ pping . in this case , dropped files can be automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location and drop it . once you enter there letters , only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters . &quot;
&quot; enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you type one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing space , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example , review : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bad .
you can select the sequence of rows by pressing the Ctr@@ l key and then click the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the button Add which you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the button uses undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;

with the View menu you can choose what to be displayed in the cover management . select from :
&quot; the queu@@ e management received your large collection in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . once you have set a piece into the queu@@ e , a number appears next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces are played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can easily add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the pieces in the queu@@ e administration . &quot;

&quot; this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium , even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can burn at some point later . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD with the help of copy dial@@ ogs , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form . &quot;
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
&quot; with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be used immediately by pressing the burning knob . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , so you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used all @-@ in @-@ one . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings and even possibilities for modi@@ fying the size and trimm@@ ing black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the table of contents and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is checked , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the Content View . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
the Content View is also the interface to read and drag files into the project view . the Content View is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
&quot; the header is a nar@@ rower area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wi@@ zard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to run CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the administrator ( root ) when you start the wi@@ zard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function at startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in function range , therefore it is more likely that your taste and the type of your task are decisive , which of the provided programs give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program . to be able to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD , and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Editor for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and saved in MP3 or OGG files . also , other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that code this WAV files ( compressed ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these enco@@ ders may still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) compressed into MP3 or OGG format or even in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to co@@ dec , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handle the protection , it is not possible to handle any copy@@ ri@@ ghted audio CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handle the protection , it is not possible to use a copy@@ ri@@ ghted audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the Setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily contact to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a brief listing of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you can find more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection with a different encoder can be read as the default . it is to be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager to code an already selected file rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols / pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
&quot; opens the main folder dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cards ( such as Enco@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here , you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right co@@ dec . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; mon@@ key &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information from data compression depending on your psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important , since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing og@@ g playback devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should be listened to other devices like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all tracks of a title . good enough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and Aut@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ unds . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ S@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ dec and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch will need to be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters which can be used ( = button designation in the wi@@ zard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , so that all others can download / enter the information instead of entering the computer instead of themselves . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note by the translator ) I am not a lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online playback of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be selected on the tab for setting up the co@@ dec . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the co@@ dec can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined coding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ver is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a co@@ dec , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . thereby , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ dec . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write per@@ missions ( eg ; by trying to copy something with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what kind of reading &amp; CD has to be repeated .
&quot; here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b utility to download the files from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them when reading a &amp; CD ; change once the right settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map general settings . here there &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be as bel@@ ated / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
please select only for incomplete information so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and can download the &amp; CD data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the computer while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is changed with a low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied using the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change the directory entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change the directory entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , this is more than 620 MB . if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as regards the server , as though many fire@@ walls are using the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time obsol@@ ete pieces : excuse , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and encoding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the CD ; to be ej@@ ected at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are saved . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be left to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the tag generation to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest like in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files simultaneously to enco@@ ded : with a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we have just completed the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD works ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , since we are comfortable and the CD ; the process described in this section has to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data obtained for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually input data instead of extrac@@ ting them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this book .
&quot; if this is not done , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this can only be identified as an audio CD ; it could be read and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , check the FAQ section and find answers to the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; - the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retrieval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what is &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; do not have unlimited field length , at least on what is &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags new . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats .
for more information go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under skir@@ t .
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the records of the piece in any case and other information you want . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark before each row of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all pieces are selected or select the Select All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
&quot; by clicking on the Del@@ ete button select the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the posts and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the jobs tab to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the toolbar buttons . &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to MP3 format . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only one that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and coding ( but two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last song is read , while another piece is deco@@ ded and a third order is written in the queu@@ e of the co@@ dec . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window opens with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the encoding of your choice . &quot;
&quot; you can download the package k@@ dem@@ ulti@@ media from your distribution . if you are reading this , you probably already have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , once running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? anyone reading this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; wei@@ rd when you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of lyrics also has some features that other &amp; Unix ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the used method .
&quot; when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
first you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button play in the toolbar , select the record from the menu item or press the space key . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played succ@@ essi@@ vely . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . in order to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the spac@@ ebar , like a pressure on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . pressing the space key while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song accomp@@ anim@@ ent and others both . some pieces do not have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which a song is used , but you still have the option to change this when you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the menu items or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summari@@ ze . in this section you &apos;ll see how you can make use of collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find them in the menu item under the point Organ@@ ize . click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the j@@ umps in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to no other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . consider that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it needs to be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when it is opened ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the next opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is specified . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop down list above kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to ski@@ p a song , select the Next Song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the button Previous Piece , Set the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map perfectly translat@@ es general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and therefore always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required compositions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except for the Key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . &quot;
&quot; define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define Key@@ map &quot; &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; &quot; ... EN@@ D define Key@@ map &quot; &quot; A more Key@@ map &quot; &quot; ... EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define Key@@ map ... &quot;
see that define is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches from General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ als sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; &quot; Drum @-@ Patch &quot; &quot; the patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is needed to indicate how tones depicted on a specific channel or instrument .
&quot; as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to form tones on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to train some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , make it easy in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful in order to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in what ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there is no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave . unfortunately , try to try some key@@ boards up to one oc@@ tave higher . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see what sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a tool , the knob does not illumin@@ ate more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu below the Channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to perform very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
&quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file .
&quot; if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , switch the automatic addition to the collection and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the mi@@ di files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. you just want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid as well and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?

&quot; the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MP@@ layer or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , VCD , or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called do@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defini@@ tive playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / , can be changed by an editor but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to select play@@ lists from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost if the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without the same playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animations when starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ long option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during boot does not need to be short , it will be stopped automatically by opening another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive in the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ doors &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L will be supported by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer . &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; . here you can set the path from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here you can see the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ ders in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even add the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos;@@ in HTML pages you need to specify the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the configuration dialog File Stat@@ ements of K@@ DE .
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and networking support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile ; needed .
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages from &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the tile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of experience with latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation should be considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the tile should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or requests , please contact K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; free environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the opportunity to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . in addition , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the latex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual on Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; K@@ ile , can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly with reading the chapter . &quot;
a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it origin@@ ates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Assistant by &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . some settings can also be made to the document .
&quot; document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , study ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; encoding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; latex ; for the integration they need to be selected only in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used when creating German texts . &quot;
new users do not have to worry about it . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&quot; by &amp; K@@ ile ; if you see bigger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( such as \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile , an empty line ( for example \ \ begin { command } ) generates a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu Mode ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful as soon as a DVI , file &#91; poin@@ ter D e V ice I n@@ Insider File ) &#93; is created , j@@ umps &amp; c@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI , -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the look search , the elements of the DVI file are drawn with the editor and as soon as an item was cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked to the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source code is applied to the corresponding point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other included .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings . &quot;
quick mounting : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is carried out to another garment , and there is no appeal of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Other can be used to add items such as Tags , foot@@ notes or references . the available items are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or another element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; manually written .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name of GrÃ ¶ Ã ¼ ler e is used for the establishment of a written font . it can be specified for the main text , the results , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the Assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class command contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or Kn@@ op@@ f &apos;s fast construction . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors . when using quick assembly , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written consent e 12 will be created and only a few columns should have another written letter . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ end { environment } , \ \ end { environment } , \ \ end { environment } , \ \ end { environment } , \ \ end { environment } , \ \ end { environment } , \ \ end { environment } , \ \ end { environment } will allow a further written permission in the environment . &quot;
the changes are reserved only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to determine the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for the aggres@@ si@@ veness and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a phrase can be expressed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is followed for the creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wi@@ zard had entered a bit of text , a few adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( for internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi Issue including Printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI , file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - by clicking on DVI , the document can be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI is created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the search search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries .
&quot; to search for the pre@@ text search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source code and can be cli@@ cked on to preview . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer will then take place . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI , document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document by &amp; K@@ ile ; used as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; if a mistake has been made , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file always causes the source of error in the source code . in the editor , then the g@@ loss@@ ary of La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be cli@@ cked . in order to view the defective line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; j@@ umps to the defective line . &quot;
&quot; once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can either be written from scratch or used by the wi@@ zard for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; level user of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be opened or create a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a new file , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by typ@@ ing in a document class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ zard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps have been completed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any latex ; files created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be carried out . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and emphasis from many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be done in the menu tools directly from &amp; K@@ ile ; .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual is to be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile , can start working directly with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical and natural latex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with twi@@ sted Ctr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with a bent Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source code and highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can add additional spr@@ ing@@ marks inside the text . this is a unique type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu items do not allow the jump to the next or last spr@@ ing@@ time . thereby , this jump tag is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; latex ; source code have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; specific commands for their selection . under Edit , the following commands for selecting text are included : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning automatically refers to tables , and latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
select the language in which this site should be shown
&quot; to extingu@@ ish a part of the document , this may be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the following commands to remove the text . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the following commands to remove the text : &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit the paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for further commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; . &quot;
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of ne@@ sted environment commands , the operator can quickly get lost . this command stops the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not atom@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . &quot;
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the sof@@ ter clasp .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot;
if the cursor is before or behind the loop of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a large number of ne@@ sted groups cl@@ amps , the over@@ look can be lost quickly . this command stays the last modified group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not atom@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple quotes are used for example . for the practical implementation is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the &quot; &quot; sign &quot; &quot; is used for two simple quotes . also for the ending of the application , the character is used . &quot;
this automatic introduction of double quotes can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used to use specific settings ( e.g. german or french ) and for German or French applications . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
within a table environment sleep &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a complete line break .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments , and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) to each other . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already has a good source code completion , it was added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) still expanded . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by means of \ \ begin { environment } will be called &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and can be divided into the complete list . on the other hand , the list can shr@@ ink by entering another letter . &quot;
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters .
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile , set up ... K@@ ile ; complete the settings on these lists . it can be used to complete various W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as expressions of common language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for execution of environments . on the other hand , there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for execution of environments is used . &quot;
the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that the ambient full@@ ness can be res@@ umed by pressing the input key .
&quot; once this has been completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; K@@ ile , det@@ ects that it is a listing environment , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; complete the settings to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ list of the full @-@ command mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&quot; for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor is introduced via Ctr@@ l + Alt key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be completely shut down . here also the threshold value for the display of the completion can be specified .
&quot; the completed files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the graphics include graphics as easy as possible . to the overview of the basics on the graphics formats , the sections should be followed and followed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to view the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Installation command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no connected be@@ holder should be used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
a new project is about the project Neues Projekt .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when exec@@ uting the fil@@ ename , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows exec@@ uting the EC@@ C script code . the scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the exec@@ uting environment of the scripts is in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = tile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; latex ; is a quite common system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to support the users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and a more &amp; latex ; reference .
&quot; it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contained and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important reading marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or stro@@ kes . by &amp; K@@ ile ; only the results will be displayed .

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you create random sig@@ natures or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature from the signature file is read by &amp; k@@ sig . by many sig@@ natures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails in a varied and unique way . &quot;
&quot; for daily sig@@ natures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day you use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select Ctr@@ l ; N File New . this allows you to save a blank ; empty sig@@ natures ; in the Sig@@ natures tab , click the Save ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section . &quot;
you can create as many sig@@ natures as you like . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail applications such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails in private or professional use there are always enough sig@@ natures .
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then Rem@@ ove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; to change a short command , select an action from the list . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 needed . to attach signature to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature code from the output of a command . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use Kom@@ mander as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows my opinion and how excellent it is . do we add it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click on the symbol for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an index.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index.@@ doc@@ book is located in the shared work@@ folder , then remove the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file is index.@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current work folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where index.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is f@@ law@@ ed . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to scan by means of another file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed check selection . &quot;
&quot; for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG validation is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then leave the file selected simply . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection . &quot;
specify the name of the file named after the result . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; laugh@@ ed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this allows the plugin system to benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plugins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . more about this can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start using the menu plug @-@ in . this dialog opens : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage and add all the plugins included . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often , several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; support team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . the nickname is the user &apos;s nickname and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button s@@ etze . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears fat after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on remarks .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the team members : an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something specific happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is added to the CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see may be a team or sub@@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
input notes is simple . it can either select the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nickname of the selected nickname of the team member , should be given the respective area or sub@@ project leader , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles are independent of upper or lower case names but spaces around par@@ enth@@ eses and : make the comment invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using the Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one another .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optionally lock optional tags : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
&quot; automatic update : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into corresponding coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e@@ yp@@ s to detect various types of files .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) but this setting here is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . &quot;
&quot; backup copies : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; perio@@ dic@@ ally generate backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next launch of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in an own view ( or documentation in a carton ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously . &quot;
reset the default window settings to the default to the next start is useful when the user interface changes through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / app@@ end views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message section is used to control the possibility to display warning messages by hooks of no more demand .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ clause means something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at best known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it does not lie at a stand@@ alone like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin during the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load component in &quot; read @-@ only mode &quot; : check if the plugin ref@@ uses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the not @-@ needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was implemented , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations by plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin selection box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action is used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging demands . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally no attention has to be taken into consideration . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the link to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is shown in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if this happens before a de@@ bug request has been started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; displays the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without providing information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution starts as soon as a request is requested . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script .
notice the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;

&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow quick insertion of tags in a document without any danger of a writing mistake . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but a folder . they only contain the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
&quot; this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag , which is a single element type element . &quot;
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
returns the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the data source .
&quot; it requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current day . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but look at &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be sub@@ stituted , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; upload function is described . the fil@@ ename of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; encoding : ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( detect automatically ) ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) ut@@ f @-@ 16 ( Unicode , worldwide ) &quot;
the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this allows you to edit di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :

an action can be set with settings actions ... click on new action to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the button User , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on it it is not limited ) , which change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Schnell@@ start -@@ Dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ s . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way , $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There is another special variable that can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / removed from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , process . if von &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be received ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are written to the default output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written to the default output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you need to add and configure promotions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; Edit Day &quot; &quot; when available so that input when using the action is possible . &quot;
ign@@ ite ! is it a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the menu ; , Graphics More Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; edit by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually displayed as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least add a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will include a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus functions to the toolbar or it should be split into several groups for a better overview .
&quot; I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start knob .
the new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the ability to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
&quot; func@@ name &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = fac@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation as something : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but look at &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files be replaced .
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation should be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of del@@ im@@ ited context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not get rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at different places , there is an email with email , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ p@@ g key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you may need to fill in . in the New resource box , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and by clicking OK the upload must be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , toolbar , toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before the installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages currently not currently by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . it &apos;s the easiest way to convert DT@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . after that the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions@@ line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to be able to understand and take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you have to famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three divisions : global , local and projected . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi user environment at the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements present a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construc@@ tor windows , the boards with information and the tool bars . please propose in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the drag @-@ button with the right mouse button to retrieve a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all file tra@@ ilers , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , ski@@ p to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands for the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane leads to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse @-@ cursor , or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse @-@ cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the editor window , the editors of the editor are located . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click on the symbol representing the tag . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to open and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with tab@@ s are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . more on templates is available in . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with E@@ Mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree opens . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ oeu@@ v@@ r@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the alignment system on the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zer shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
this tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zer shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . display them on a symbol , and they will display the corresponding command . the cho@@ col@@ ates of the toolbar can be defined as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , send the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , files on your system . for that , auto@@ conf gives a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems while starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions . &quot;
&quot; while striving to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what would if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the most awesome web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim , it must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why evol@@ ve what already somebody else has developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to expand as they need for their needs . &quot;
&quot; automation enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers concluded the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more details in the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , or help k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta . &quot;

&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . see the Tem@@ plates section . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; writing , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form of format@@ ting . &quot;
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; writing which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the drop @-@ tag .
switch the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift key .
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the script settings and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar at the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this enables e.g. to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded another input / output modules ( K@@ IO Slave ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in Project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or Project .
&quot; this creates a dialog to add a new toolbar . it only creates the name . actions must be saved by settings actions ... and you will be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this delet@@ es them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( maybe at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the toolbar as attachment .
enables the up@@ loading of toolbar to the main server where everyone else can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own file description format .
&quot; loading / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu item in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is denied by means of a toolbar if this day is contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items above . click on it . click an activated plug @-@ in to disable it . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ mode for the current file . the list of available versions schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; very useful if you know people that use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; Instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the map @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which you can add and change sequences .
&quot; this should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial support , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be completed from top to bottom because , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled out automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ port@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be attached . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . &quot;
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to your own properties .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work .
some settings correspond to those in the project wi@@ zard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) that will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additionally , files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;

this allows you to select the required de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button . in this case the de@@ bug@@ ging is described .
&quot; up@@ loading profiles can be set up in the sub@@ window profiles ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for each profile contents by clicking your own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event actions can be disabled , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . currently , this behavior cannot be affected . &quot;
to open another project choose project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; change files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management view gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders also behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the kernel memory and forgot about program . this option is useful when a frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ afe password saved on the disk is not ques@@ tioned .
this will stop the transfer or simply exit the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project Tool@@ bar menu or the Project Tool@@ bar menu . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , toolbar buttons in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ able over the menu toolbar . use and addition differ . adding tool bars is handled below in the addition of tool bars . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , which can be specified in the dialog where it can be specified , which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will also be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are in essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. ima@@ gery with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
these art templates are useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and choose File As template save As a template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template save sel@@ ections as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged and dro@@ pping onto the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template to enter a name for the template . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ define head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep a lot of things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; if a root folder would be set , it would appear in a root folder . if nothing appears , it will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; allows previous or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , and allows you to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates into a folder with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document called &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Edit Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Edit Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Edit Editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first one except that at the same time changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor will be visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already activated , the key moves the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta . after selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also possible , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used for the reduction of the V@@ PL ; this can be changed : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing , by pressing a button or Rem@@ ove Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way using the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags previously is not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other adjacent anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are gra@@ yed out . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists need to be used .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be tra@@ cked . &quot;

&quot; in this command , a partial or complete match with a pre@@ age named QNAP or a specified model name will be verified . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP template that contains the template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be added to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;

&quot; app@@ ends the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ ZE ; and the value &amp; lt ; VAL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on the command &quot; &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if --@@ repeat is twice as specified , the conversion will be performed 100 times . &quot;
the input data will be treated as HTML files if the support for this is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml
activ@@ ates the X@@ In@@ clude processing of the input file if the support for this is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default .
&quot; on systems with Re@@ ad@@ line installed , you can scroll with the arrow keys to / off through the scroll bar of the exec@@ uting commands . &quot;
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes may be used to pass comp@@ uted expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name like &quot; x@@ sl : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ ename : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
path : a path to changing the working folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
&quot; mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the positions where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions have been added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ value file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time display the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folders merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and den@@ ies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have frequently asked Ko@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can look at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can ease your typ@@ ing by writing only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; opening dialog shows your selection and displays them again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the Comp@@ are / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
note : currently you can do nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dro@@ pping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the Info line of the source window contains the character A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , allow the mouse to rest for a while over the line . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B is green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one can see the color , which is different . if both files differ , the color scheme is red . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that is good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comment@@ aries , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separ@@ ating the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted in places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is shown on the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the compar@@ ators ) also has an Info line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to move towards the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows the group will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
&quot; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; mer@@ ging conflicts ; however , appear in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ beginning and Ctr@@ l @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the preview window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the In@@ ser@@ ted button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the assembly section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / last difference ( Ctr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ Picture For@@ ward / Str@@ g @-@ Picture A@@ way ) or to the next / previous non @-@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l Pa@@ ste ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and recovered during the next start . ( set up Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when activ@@ ating this option , differences are displayed in a cur@@ sive script . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed ast@@ ores . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically set an un@@ regulated color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press Enter or Return , the return of the previous line will also be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; while comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines are to be found in the source files . only during this first step , white characters are ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car return mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; , &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slow in very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict continues . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all the conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you are using this only from time to time , then use better functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be added to the suff@@ ix .@@ original . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must end &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is available globally via the control center . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; through the selection fields for the encoding , a brief reference appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processor commands . &quot;
&quot; note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignor@@ es C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded revision column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C , next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information is displayed . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines .
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files together . a simple click starts merge and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as default name for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge operation then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
&quot; when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this function for example to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users greater flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this command line to convert lines to upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ l@@ usi@@ ve expression that matches all characters in one line .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically create generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) .
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ations@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / switch &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and show the sim@@ ulated changes without really performing it
&quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , a small message window will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared . &quot;
when the scanning of the folder is complete shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the + / - button or click the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all the folders .
&quot; double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; however , in identical entries the color is also identical even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then also folders have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical but not B : copy from B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. A folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
&quot; mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and when the check@@ box is active , select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then check &amp; check@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging , one file will be processed after the other . it displays status column he@@ avier once the merge was successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is complete , you should make a final review and see if the status is OK . &quot;
&quot; this contains the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge @-@ actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the three folder merge mode C is used as the target , with the two folder mer@@ ging B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory conver@@ sions to run / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if corrupt file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears which indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options through , sim@@ ulate , and Cancel . &quot;
&quot; choose &quot; &quot; Sim@@ ulate &quot; &quot; if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select again your folder merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then drag &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem or ski@@ p the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged together , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again later . even if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
ignore files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this file can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the date of change and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the modification date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal to them . for example , this can be useful when copying the change date . please use caution when copying the chan@@ gel@@ og . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the files will be selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , as it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be added directly , and the file will not run once again when you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; this status is lost , however , when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date differ from the original . ( note the option of Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences @-@ viewer . to start k@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - K@@ diffusion 3 . note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merge or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot while listening to the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who went this way or go it this way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and pres@@ um@@ ably not to the configure script to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not install the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger volumes of text should be used by another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c appeared ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?

copy ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift + Rem@@ ove ) copies the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders does not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change its size , end them or move them . this works both inside a work area and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the motion can be moved both inside a work area and on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with file numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , as in some other window managers ; horizontal , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal and vertical range , which is very well suited for representation at the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch sel@@ ections ... will allow the dialogue settings to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog Settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root and assign it to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; none . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly being expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; if you like &amp; k@@ like ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; you can specify a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; at present it is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the cursor res@@ ides in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ eti@@ tive straight @-@ jury syndrome ) and which every single mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; it is meant to help people who suffer from the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and to which every single mouse click pain . in addition , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . this however requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; suffering from pain caused by the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it even more clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , avoid pain that causes pain caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it has em@@ ulated the pressing of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this residence time must exp@@ ire after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click one mouse click .
&quot; when switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , waiting for the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function is activated , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the rider General . there &apos;s a sli@@ ders sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the last bend of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not display a link , does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be very clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click , and the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to have it . but don &apos;t use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ cker . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the tit@@ le@@ bar of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics . &quot;
&quot; smart shifting is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to mark text , copy it into the clip@@ board , or to insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart delay if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this saves time when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click , so you know exactly when at the smart move the shooting time begins . later you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and are used to treat the pains of the mouse .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that dum@@ b users can talk to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the Wi@@ zard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text@@ book text@@ book . you can select the text passages often used , without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you define the dictionary for the word word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a cache of the spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
&quot; with the menu item Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ tag page as well as the K@@ TT@@ X language support page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card language , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , set the character encoding that is passed on to the speech generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as a standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the t@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications require a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ X is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you decide which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection from So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the cache . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is entered first only in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field , the editing window for text pass@@ book lets you decide whether the text password is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you select any changes , the text@@ book register will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ tag page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for words . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth , a drop @-@ down box displays , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
select the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pass@@ agen@@ das are presented as a tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar , or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable line for text passages is displayed with entries . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not enter the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings for mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the language output command on the card language . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it only supports the English language . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax f@@ ades the last sign of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / m@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line .
the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ X ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ X is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s .
&quot; since the language generator settings are only done in the K@@ TT@@ X , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Options dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ X is installed . &quot;
&quot; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the speech generator ) , but this depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people unable to speak text through the computer . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer needs to be installed .

&quot; before you can use it , you must install and correct speech speech disp@@ at@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card reader will appear . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card will be shown in General . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer can be compared with multiple printers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the board of map@@ s. or@@ ator in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all speakers already set out appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; t@@ aps .
&quot; select a mood type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a young and female voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ own ; almost use it . go back to the card box General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ X ) , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map to create and manage text entries . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language selection system . click on the map @-@ map &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ own ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ xxx ) . if this start is successful , the card orders will be displayed and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ X and remove the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ xxx ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the read is complete . &quot;
&quot; the buttons in this series allow you to start , cancel , stop and record text orders . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ IST is started . to start K@@ TT@@ X , click on the tab &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and tick the voice @-@ over@@ s there ( K@@ TT@@ xxx ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check the text you want to read and select the text that is to be read . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ head@@ lines and other un@@ seen brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read and select Tools Text in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various kinds of messages . you can set up &amp; configure ; for example , set up a message in which your nickname appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;

&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be accepted as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ on ; filter is not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the speech speech pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the ordered orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will res@@ ume after the issue of warning .
a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you receive from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text Entries are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ a@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; this output is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reels . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter editing the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; t@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; converter uses a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ S@@ LT files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have a female voice chosen on the card reader , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not true , the text remains unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication on &amp; kt@@ ts ; is sent , it will be processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the usual normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter and the following set @-@ up dial@@ ogs will be displayed below .
&quot; for setting up string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged against the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can select this name as you like , it only has to be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is used only if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; Ctr@@ l key when you click the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
you can get the application ID running programs with q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates you are allowed to enter only copies .
&quot; the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box seal filter if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
&quot; the dial @-@ up filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board card or@@ ator , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected according to the speaker features , which define the program , which sets the text at &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board . the speaker can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will apply if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be chosen to display the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the speech input filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box seal filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
voice @-@ over@@ s API from &amp; k@@ de ; with the program@@ mers can give T@@ TS skills to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ D via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ X module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ IST using the voice syn@@ thesizer , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the Voice Output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice @-@ sharing services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of text to read and option is a language code such as eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ Windows . launch only kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thesi@@ zers are supporting my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so that SA@@ BLE is working at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause error in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter . see . &quot;

&quot; KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . hence , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the webpage of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand and extend for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the speech &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from source tag for k@@ de@@ file , or have downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program using the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before doing so , check first , whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text will be dis@@ assembled into single sets . the user can leave pun@@ ctu@@ ation or off@@ sets , repeat , stop or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its sex is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in . &quot;
&quot; for example , the device for Festival Interactive will be displayed below . for example , the module for Festival Interactive will be displayed below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is handed over to the festival . in case of voices that are known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these slide controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this grey , the voice you have chosen does not leave these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to load . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ IST so that ( with higher memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or simply click App@@ ly ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr can be seen in the system section , but not the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ X reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the exactly edited sentence . the Spe@@ aker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card reader . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can proceed alternatively in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the OK button , all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; there are only text orders listed and managed . outputs of screen reels , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . &quot;
&quot; set the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ als half and 200@@ g ; % about twice normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for running the running .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special actions , which will always be executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is applied to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the ordered orders will be res@@ umed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , greet someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output to the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; select this check box to activate the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and not@@ ices ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are selected by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click Add , a dialog will appear where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this check@@ box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that is displayed as the top record in the list on the card board . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if for a specific event of a specific application , action is specified , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . otherwise , the action is applied to all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the sending noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML is only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations exist :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ d ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ . &quot;
&quot; encoding : ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( detect automatically ) ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( Unicode , worldwide ) ut@@ f @-@ 16 ( Unicode , worldwide ) &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into single sentences . this allows you to start or stop invo@@ king orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the Stat@@ ute Identi@@ fier Filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up as the default . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ level det@@ ectors , but beginners will be advised of it . &quot;
&quot; in the simpl@@ est way , you will learn the setup of the language selection by trying out . switch off the voice selection and enter the text to read . check the language selection once again , change some features and check how the subscri@@ ber &apos;s selection is changed . &quot;
&quot; only the first movement has to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can take a very long time , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel your text orders on the card card , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal Stat@@ ute Identi@@ fication Filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
set @-@ level recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for set @-@ ups and add a tab@@ lat@@ ator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional borders ( tab symbols are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
&quot; BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal Stat@@ ute Rec@@ ogni@@ tion Filters , you can paste it again by load the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file included . &quot;
you can over@@ write subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the Card@@ board Card . the card card will be displayed if
the use of the standard speaker ( the top of the board card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; dict@@ ate ; otherwise choose the speaker . otherwise choose the speaker , the closest to the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the speaker you want . if this property does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
select this check box when the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker field , which is closest to the following , click on the default Spe@@ aker box and then use Spe@@ aker who is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the final text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; t@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; you may need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may need to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the console ; appears a message stating : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA may occur , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions please visit the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I loaded an extra voice for festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices to the new voice . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able by the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zed modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card interface . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; if you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ on @-@ SS@@ ML trans@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speed of speech . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ sl file turns to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own string replacement filter , and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ own ; no longer sentence pre@@ - or go back . on the board of orders is displayed , the job consists of only one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter out pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : ensure that the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience conflicts in audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system is also part of this , you can &apos;t play music simultaneously and start reading a text . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support any real breaks . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can then install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you downloaded and downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependence of non @-@ free software .

accessibility echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zers whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with Festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to type a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA , a syn@@ thesizer . this creates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
notice that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; instead , please note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install the Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; you will find instructions in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package that you downloaded . ( for the use with Festival 2.0 , it is not necessary to re@@ build a festival ) . then add the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and release level . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gra@@ yed grey , which means that the settings can be viewed only , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter system administration mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
&quot; the tab network interfaces serve to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings displayed in the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the option of automatic TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system sends all necessary TCP / IP information at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at the same time with the start of system services . &quot;
&quot; with the manual mode manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the address field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in der &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or de@@ activated depending on your needs . to turn off a switched off network device , select from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or de@@ activated depending on your needs . disable an activated network device , by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
sets the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain address by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requests http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution is a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted , removed or altered by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Hin@@ ts or Her@@ mit in priority . &quot;
clicking the button Add ... from the group computer to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It is displayed in the Edit menu .
the List Name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the host name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub @-@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small and closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
&quot; usually , the list of known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , press the add button and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will be displayed .
&quot; it may be one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command will be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the completed compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended for experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second all of them are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the inclusion of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread distribution .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be allocated . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is to be filed or , if available , the IP address can not be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a domain reserved specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore its arbitr@@ ary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application , with which you can run other programs running on a timet@@ able in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ® system program cr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of tasks that are already set up and corresponding environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear both for all users of the system and for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and closed . &quot;
&quot; in a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not displayed and the description appears disabled . &quot;
&quot; the environment variables appearing here set out the otherwise existing environment variables for all the tasks listed above . when a de@@ activated variable appears , it appears as a description . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to be started . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press Select .... &quot;
choose the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; for example , when you specify the day and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the selected months independently of the day of the week , and also on every Sunday of the month , no matter which date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , first select the task to be removed . then proceed to edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select cut out , or press Ctr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then proceed to edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select Copy , or press Ctr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first one has to be edited or copied to the clip@@ board . only then is past@@ ing available at all . select the tasks folder . then go to Edit Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the tasks folder and select Insert , or press Ctr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , first select an application . then go to the Edit Change menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and change ... select , or press Ctr@@ l ; O. It will then process the dialog box in which you can edit the selected task as described above . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task to be deleted . then go to the Edit menu item Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to activate or de@@ activate a task , select it , and specify the state with the menu item Edit En@@ abled . in@@ active tasks are marked in their description with In@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select En@@ abled . &quot;

the second aim was to create several archives on a tape . the first objective was to create several archives on a tape . the first objective was to create several archives on a tape . the first objective was to create a surface for tar which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast and selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; drop the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre@@ stres@@ sing on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t find it , you will be asked if the belt index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol is changed for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was inserted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape by &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a tape drive must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not require format@@ ting to be form@@ atted before using . flo@@ ppy disks are usually prec@@ eded by format@@ ting the tape , but DAT drives do not require . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; continue with the band &apos;s format@@ ting . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before cont@@ acting the backup procedure , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the dialog opens up Settings . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click on any of the archives and select the item ...
&quot; once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog will appear for Veri@@ fication . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit procedure as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the files with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog box will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the desktop for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file on the basis of the belt contents . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can recre@@ ate the index in two ways :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected work folder .
folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately from the same file system as the folder . each entry is viewed by tar independent of the other file systems .
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of the buttons holds ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ reci@@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command is loaded load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , it will automatically be ej@@ ected by the end of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; it is automatically ej@@ ected by the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy players . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted a tape , write a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar files which can be managed directly with GNU / - tar . even other tar versions should work unless they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a hed@@ ging tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about issues that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don &apos;t know where to get information about your system , or where the system is depos@@ iting the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
&quot; support for many different types of log@@ files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after start trying to open &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will not be displayed , and it will not appear with system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or after entered strings . in the default setting , the log line will only be displayed , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then be sub@@ trac@@ ted only with entries in the selected column . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are indicated with a more noticeable color than protocol lines of the level indicator . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off in the direction dialog .
&quot; if you only want to view specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to pop up new lines in the main window context menu to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system is quickly becoming the standard for monitoring the program starts when the system starts operating in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( among other things because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a rein@@ st@@ allation and reform@@ at@@ ting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services don &apos;t include such things as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services don &apos;t include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls do not include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , even if you don &apos;t have much use for it . you can also have a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial section :
&quot; if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change it , then you can repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start these scripts from hand on command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ stit@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it elsewhere . this will not happen if you remove an entry from the field of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you drag them into a new area . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you need to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add them to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore records thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it to clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before exec@@ uting them . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine is constantly changing . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press Enter key to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / init@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be attached . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save In menu File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will be created where you can make individual settings . further card cards may appear if Shadow Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd can be installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the password administration tab will appear if Shadow passwords are installed or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
&quot; this card only appears if there is limited space limitation ( quot@@ a ) for at least a native file system ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be modified for each user , whereby the space restrictions in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the Field Fil@@ esystem with limited space limitation .
&quot; the card groups will inform you about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user is , you will find in the field Pri@@ mary . furthermore , the user can join in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate addition button of the toolbar . edit or delete the selected user or group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add and change the boot password , remove and change the time up to the boot of the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
