<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-based workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are identical to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web that match your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on colour management. unfortunately, color management means you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. unfortunately, color management means you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your educational workflow meets all the criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image issues are via e-mail or web, where sRGB is de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"if so sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so simple, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color foams, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"the callibration of your monitor closes the circle. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, then you need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>
<seg id="387">Notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalizing, Comparison, Auto Comparison and Contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminance values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"at times, the same amount of pixels makes the same number of pixels. sometimes the same number of pixels makes the same number of pixels."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic synchronization: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jiuscation of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is something limited because of a color space of 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can use the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithms protected by Pawel T. Jochnym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"in the upper right corner a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. with a button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or down the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat using the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons store and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance you set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences Button once again reset all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw pictures. it uses the change and the allocation of color profiles. colour mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu of Color Precision Correction. this tool provides an integrated path to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you always need the same error. in the manual for the correction of the sample, you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the digitizing effect is provided by four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar polarization was also called Sabatier, an effect that arose when one partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash light and subsequently reversed the development of the picture. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the extra light. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar polarization. at approx. 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopapers.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large pictures the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photo. you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photo using the tools in the menu. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to increase saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous thickness / contrast / gamma, the mold correction is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog becomes very complicated for this tool, you need only the area of the slider for the application described here. more specific the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graphene of the intensity values, an histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three slide gates are clicked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box you can set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic arrangement is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp Levels Format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, resources and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selector allows to specify the channel modifying the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that have been recorded with a digital camera, linear mode is usually the most useful. in this case, logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you shift a curve part to the right, e.g. the light tones, then you can see that these light tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels will become darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"on the preview of the original photos, a red marker is visible. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"if you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect in the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Underneath you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the luminance duct. shadow and sun shades have been set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">Channel mixer of & digikam; image processing is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the Channel Selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first reference how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image a vertical line in the histogram will display you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">"controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to keep Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness, as the channel mixer then is the tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits."</seg>
<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when mixing Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space."</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save and load any Mixer setting for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="448">"the option overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>

<seg id="471">"for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of file size of the stencil. if you want to add your template to the digimaster; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org."</seg>
<seg id="472">"if you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files."</seg>
<seg id="473">"after the root folder is set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template of the templates."</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">You can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera has often been used internal focus. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a depth of field while reading the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry Correct Archiving."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should handle it carefully, since the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. generally, you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much simpler than it is to sharpen. use the tool to sharpen soft marks with the menu entry Correct softer and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a gun are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow for larger radii. they should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred picture to be added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are exempted from sharpness and hence beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">This & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Film. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a sharpness mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing on colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, circular folding works much better than the Gauß 's circuit."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"if you use a value equal to zero, you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the gauss's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocussed parameter you have placed will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, and eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharply Masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by making the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"for the Viennese filter, the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the Unity mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often at least as good as the Unity mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of focussing in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink tinte allows for a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and Advanced Settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granting or CCD scratches, a high value wave-like patterns are generated. JPEG Artefacts are best fixed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above allit. p then defines relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle increment da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the quality that you receive by choosing this option is only small. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to release it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons store and load exactly this. correct any hiring of image errors can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">"error correction is comparatively very fast to work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artifacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">"the digikam, noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert."</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read these in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise which can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases only the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">"a radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG Artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the tolerance value of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more obscure, but also merges the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls adjusting the phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smooth, if it is too high, the edges appear to be removed. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">The solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to sharpen soft marks with the menu entry Correct softer and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digikam. photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filtering gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film basins, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are to be seen in uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">"the buttons store and load exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file, and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast to work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Bead button."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniformity reduction will be restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera was recorded on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film bastion on the faces. the original image is below (1) and that corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures have been applied to an old color photo created using a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="553">"it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp."</seg>

<seg id="555">"this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and" quot; bright Pixelquot; in a photo with a darkbrown subtraction method, there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels. "</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark picture directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark image to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows the last dark image and automatically charges it in the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of neighboring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block are used to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are pulled up to interpolate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interrupt the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interrupt the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"the digikam, Vignettierungscorrection is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>

<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's film and colour chart of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using a center filter that is done without this filter. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light gain absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with vignettifying correction decreases the luminosity of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings."</seg>

<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image if the limitations of the resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size modifies a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. splinters interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the Tabs New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the buttons store as and store are used exactly to do this. to enlarge each thumbnail for photo can be saved as a text file, and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflatable is very fast in what it does, but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Bead button."</seg>
<seg id="639">The original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear default magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">"cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you need to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, then you'll see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"when you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X)."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the Preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the width of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the selected relation and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">The modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data are reflected in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the cooperation help allow you to blend in, so that you can get your images together better. these help are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious divides are based on the principle of similarity.</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden mean is divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the glassworks of a sunflower."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the figure derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden mean provides liquid resource lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos. in comparison to the third-level rule, the golden spirals create a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river on this type."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles."</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also derive from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect of dynamic symmetry of professional photographers. try to place your imagery at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Mirrors and Vertical Mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it is easy to hold the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angular. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button Preferences you can set the slider to 0 degrees again. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the module Free rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformed cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically cut the function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-Aliasing smoothes the image a bit after rotation. notice however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation into pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels."</seg>

<seg id="675">Angle Right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes a little lubricated. for individual adjustment, this effect is small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you adjusted the perspective, you get unwanted triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the shearing tool is used to shift part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. in other words, a right angle is turned into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"drag your image by using the Horizontal Angle and Vertical Angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumbnail."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shear, the picture is wiped a little. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two shocks generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">"it needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system but you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath.</seg>

<seg id="814">"when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed, which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone."</seg>
<seg id="815">"the setting for maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation from below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from a place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">"the options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these boundaries here and then press the button correlate for interpolating."</seg>
<seg id="818">"the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have set a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog shows the coordinates from a call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo."</seg>

<seg id="847">"the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"in the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that displays a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image changes."</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set up next. in doubt you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG file file.</seg>
<seg id="850">"if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start drinking coffee quickly, or in any rest, and enjoy the slideshow when you are back."</seg>

<seg id="853">"this kipi module allows you to import or convert your images stored in RAW files in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">"the conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: don't you expect the same results as the software from your camera creator. sometimes, you get better results with dcraw!"</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file which is to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are happy with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image File Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or use them later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allowed a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the raw file will be saved in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Start button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressing."</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>

<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">"proportional (1 dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional in size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">"print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when displaying smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you switch off anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling gets the neighbouring pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray each pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 pixels will be calculated by following a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixels will be divided into 4 subpixels that can be tracked individually and be checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset InSane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map perfectly translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands."</seg>

<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches from General MIDI will be displayed on your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equals sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional All KeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term" "Drum-Patch" "the patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is needed to indicate how tones depicted on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to form tones on the percussions channel. see for example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to train some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful in order to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for Pitch BenderRatio specifies in what ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that there is no decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a Pitch Bender event with the value 4096, will play a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play two sounds up to one octave. unfortunately, try to try some keyboards up to one octave higher."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a tool, the knob does not illuminate more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu in the Settings menu below the Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to perform very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's home page)"</seg>

<seg id="2050">"press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete."</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus functions to the toolbar or it should be split into several groups for a better overview.</seg>
<seg id="2052">"I would like to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"for example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Note how the separator support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & conqueror; -button is the opposite of the start knob.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"after new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most important extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the ability to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"funcname [Tree] Doc dir = Path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Your description for these documentations, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html tag1 = fac2.html tag1 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation as something:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except the reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but look at & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation should be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of delimited context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not get rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at different places, there is an email with email, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive from where all others & quantaplus, users can download them."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you may need to fill in. in the New resource box, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and by clicking OK the upload must be started."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD packet (DTEP) menu, toolbar, toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before the installation, check & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML-languages currently not currently by & quantaplus, but it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. it's the easiest way to convert DTD automatically to a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi user environment at the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"local elements present a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editing pane leads to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tag under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse-cursor."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the upper end of the editor window, the editors of the editor are located. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs."</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the positions where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-value file browser.</seg>

<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be added to the suffix .original. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>

<seg id="2339">"the following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is enabled, the upper setting is used for all entries."</seg>

<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processor commands."</seg>

<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded revision column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -GT; C or B & lt; -GT; C, next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines.</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files together. a simple click starts merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for output file.

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file it is handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. you can use this function for example to cut disruptive parts or to correct the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file it is given first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command processor. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow users greater flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line to convert lines to uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an erglusive expression that matches all characters in one line.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically create generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution).</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiffusion. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line deviations. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed, you can use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / switch 'However, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal processor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. every order you receive from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text Entries are intended for the output of longer texts, which have no special urgency."</seg>

<seg id="2834">Installation of the completed compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">"alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"for this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"this is recommended for experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"in the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be given, in the second all of them are discussed by & knetworkconf."</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the inclusion of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2841">"one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be allocated. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is to be filed or, if available, the IP address can not be simply chosen arbitrarily!"</seg>
<seg id="2842">"when setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a domain reserved specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore its arbitrary use is possible."</seg>
<seg id="2843">"of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways."</seg>
<seg id="2844">"for smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers."</seg>
<seg id="2845">"in addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet."</seg>
<seg id="2846">"some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding."</seg>
<seg id="2847">"the 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle."</seg>

<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don't know where to get information about your system, or where the system is depositing the various protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog provides users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of logfiles, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after start trying to open & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will not be displayed, and it will not appear with system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or after entered strings. in the default setting, the log line will only be displayed, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then be subtracted only with entries in the selected column."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are indicated with a more noticeable color than protocol lines of the level indicator. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off in the direction dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you only want to view specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use Filterbar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the option to pop up new lines in the main window context menu to display all new added protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system is quickly becoming the standard for monitoring the program starts when the system starts operating in the & Linux world. this is because it's easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (among other things because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without a reinstallation and reformatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services don't include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services don't include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls do not include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, even if you don't have much use for it. you can also have a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial section:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change it, then you can repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start these scripts from hand on command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runstitn or change the position within a level by dragging it elsewhere. this will not happen if you remove an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you drag them into a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you need to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add them to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore records thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before executing them."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered from & ksysv; otherwise changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>

<seg id="2983">Enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press Enter key to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are launched in these distributions, simplifies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) are simply terminated if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be attached."</seg>
