&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I also grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , un@@ covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ans and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won with Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t get Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme bringing people from all over the world , a deeply faithful man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
she still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump had accepted his way to republi@@ can presidential candidates , she offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either share his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
maybe it is un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ or@@ ise people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom know , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel procedure to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note : the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash ) , as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s choice , however , a vast majority of the White Americas made this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps country , said the news . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what did the Mexican Music School of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in O@@ ax@@ aca province have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music that is played at both places , not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among the tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the church of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs . &quot;
&quot; but after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn to play day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Wa@@ ste
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as a f@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Miller ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational drama of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work effectively fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the rep@@ ublic@@ ation occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in Liberia until the other coast of Africa was looking for . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly dis@@ cour@@ aged and little inclined to welcome a criminal offen@@ se of this kind to their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do . &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u rec@@ alls , a senior citizen of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team who discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia for pill@@ aging the fish stocks . &quot;
the core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries to stop 2012 from the NGO stop Il@@ legal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries , who at that time displac@@ ed the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand in each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is tra@@ pped is hidden so it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ob@@ struc@@ ted by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also circul@@ ated by the s@@ nail of information between individual countries , the actions today occur in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to label ships , fishing in prohibited areas . also , suspic@@ ious rides can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year due to illegal fishing which penet@@ rate East African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; its practices include activities like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship was able to fish illegal and a country could then say &apos; You won &apos;t run my port &apos; . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 tests suspected of suspic@@ ious vessels . &quot;
it has discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found refugees .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ordered by satellite . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland is helping build a system that combines different levels of information . it will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally active ships with greater precision . &quot;
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the marine protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; gather together with neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of who does what where to do , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits the pursu@@ it of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimin@@ als , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships formerly conf@@ is@@ cated without licence and had little to face with consequences , know now that they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fis@@ her boats are buying more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined forces for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; with security , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country was able to report his first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . and not only was the ship underway without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans .

the movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s dism@@ iss@@ al .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the dism@@ iss@@ al , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by assembling itself on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the retreat of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among other things in the area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the dism@@ iss@@ al of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and spiral rati@@ os belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on many as the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ toral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic On@@ eness ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together . &quot;
the call has been commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil war and on November 3 all went to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October .
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the protective plates : &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images circul@@ ate from disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves beat the message about police repression in the central @-@ north of the city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ des state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira . &quot;
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear a skir@@ t because you could see anything else what many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the round , which depic@@ ts the extent of repression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has oppressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a ministry of incorpor@@ ation - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the street .

Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado say that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are forged .
here is your dism@@ iss@@ al !
on the road !
&quot; others consider this protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has made little opposition to the devast@@ ating economic crisis from their point of view , and preferred to avoid critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , who was published in Argentina on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said , in the context of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the secret of family sec@@ rec@@ y for 34 years .
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was dep@@ uty commander of the secret services department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ ved admission .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years saw the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
just ask that they don &apos;t dec@@ eive you one day and I have to save you .
ISO @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyr@@ il@@ lic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) mac@@ intosh ( Mac@@ Roman )
&quot; that &apos;s why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would be en@@ chan@@ ted .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents that had belonged to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blan@@ ket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and drove him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another person ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet .
close to the entrance ch@@ ew@@ ed people quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner , he said : &quot; &quot; what do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero collap@@ sed a man and killed .
&quot; according to information by survi@@ vors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was indic@@ ted by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - of eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War@@ ri@@ ors &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ onet , or perhaps military bad@@ ges , which one has fought against an enemy that is fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes to a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied : &quot; &quot; and you , who cho@@ ke cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against rage , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
that &apos;s why we don &apos;t need anyone else !
this is how my father was .
I have no single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a scarf pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
we were not poor but he still brought clothes to home .
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a co @-@ con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have children first , you realize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have been executed during the dictatorship of humans . but why do the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ n@@ apped children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that can be done to a human being .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was rein@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something always remains .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone .
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rej@@ ecting me , and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were suppos@@ edly def@@ ended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I received the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed , and I ended up against my own father . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was accused of 4@@ 16 crimes including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 98 cases , torture followed in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping one of the 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the order of magnitude of the judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial concluded between March 1975 and December 1978 , committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court suspended li@@ fel@@ ong sentences and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the originally 54 accused were killed during the trial .

Pi@@ ero De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Silent Chamber :

translation errors make older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its license . &quot;
the photo was distributed in social media .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can pro@@ long his driving license , last month witnesses of a very un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; Raj@@ esh &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ ss ) , which means &quot; older drivers , &quot; was mistakenly translated - but perhaps also with malicious back@@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September in electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , an inhabit@@ ant Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n newspaper published in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( english : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the jap@@ an@@ ese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents is quite a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors were 1,8@@ 03 of altogether 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the article published on Yahoo , the above @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter published comments to the light that showed what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese believed against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo over the translation errors was among other things the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
the translation is only for help because we do not guarantee the accuracy of the contents .
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the source text and learn active language skills in order to translate it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires an active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction that translat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers should be .
&quot; for example , French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translat@@ ing , costs , or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations themselves internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real . &quot;
photo by fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and mysterious phrases that arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique can not replace human translat@@ ors for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the Kyoto town will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television increase
&quot; homepage of the Portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online broadcast@@ ers included recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups who oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : enables your VPN .
it seems that internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses the request when calling a website . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , was released on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in cust@@ ody cust@@ ody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections so that access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country is more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get a training . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mean tas , who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a Cor@@ rection report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , exp@@ iring schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her degree in college , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls were forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is very simple : a large family with little money transfers her inferior son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that children will have to do a countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , this practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practices of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , as the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ mean tas is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who has her daughter in faith that she will complete her education , improve her position in society , and &quot; make something out of herself , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies the exploitation with faith means that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know of it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the sec@@ l@@ usion in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived at the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of fi@@ erc@@ ely stro@@ kes . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ dal@@ ta in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra stroke on Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered mort@@ al injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go bl@@ ur@@ red for the girl &apos;s death deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there should be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas won &apos;t only be exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign up bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all the way , and started selling swe@@ ets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
she had to share the time in such a way that she was still learning time for learning .
she stood up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; on Fri@@ days for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she did not get endless food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the owner of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a ple@@ aded not to stand next to him and to read articles of opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the official media reports of the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought it intellig@@ ently , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would be &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
they feared that they would lose the education they had made them to lose again .
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is har@@ ass@@ ment and the ch@@ ic@@ ans , which are exposed to Cri@@ mean tas if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not a group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;

bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regul@@ ating the use and utilisation of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when accepted by the Parliament , users must register in Egypt at a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would be established which is entrusted to citizens without permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs , and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are currently unable to register the registration at the level of social media companies . &quot;

&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to construct a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it has not been known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are skep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . &quot;
this is technically at all realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed by Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison term was en@@ vis@@ aged for those accused of &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only survi@@ ving pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; and the health and the flour@@ ishing of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to actually see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera ball , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to passion@@ ately reveal another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an area .

&quot; a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture , in Japan , had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to escape , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all coastal towns disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture also had an atomic accident , which is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years later in order to re@@ build the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned .
&quot; housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( Raj@@ ad@@ ay Requi@@ ff , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from accommodation shel@@ ters ( Raj@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) tried to reloc@@ ate into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 more and more people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who came home after the disaster , were moved to final homes . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could find out , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have res@@ umed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected large @-@ scale production in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood @-@ zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lag@@ s far away . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to determine a total picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ athy changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami &apos;s consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in disaster prevention . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture also witnessed the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , moved into permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 level there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the areas of disaster , most of the ev@@ ac@@ ters still in homes are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often sees that a more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone beyond language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a migration has strengthened its aff@@ ection to Iranian culture ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being attacked by the police during demonstrations of nation@@ wide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer held him with a head against the head during a demonstration in G@@ oi@@ ana . nation@@ wide , millions of demonstr@@ ators attended a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of G@@ oi@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of G@@ oi@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in G@@ oi@@ ana with his head on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed in the intensive care unit , his face would be seen six months on television and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ ici@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from G@@ oi@@ ana , distributed the video captured by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers shortly after him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , has also emerged in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus ab the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in G@@ oi@@ ana while lying at the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in G@@ oi@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; here was the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have had the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer , who has been attacked by a police officer , who hit him with a stroke . &quot;
police grips
&quot; G@@ oi@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , polic@@ emen sat in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announ@@ cements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have tu@@ cked road protests by focusing on a different , unexpected protag@@ onist : a wind@@ screen . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo have targeted a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their cover pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a particular thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of dam@@ aging .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the T@@ ables of Un@@ induc@@ ing Un@@ induc@@ ing Hav@@ en in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish Su@@ gar M@@ ills - regardless of the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar@@ s on the spot . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the succ@@ essive period the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to rein@@ vent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories which are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region there are sugar cane factories , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation again because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane mill , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests have no more news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the community already saw better times .
( picture : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became unten@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories ; the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of four Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the price of sugar rose again a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; the following years saw a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es have the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially auth@@ ored documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over@@ written and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the factory shut down for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
he was involved against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory in whose construction he helped .
&quot; with every part he removed , he demonstrated one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station has been extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for the work places and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( picture : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane mill closed , or rather , when they began to disman@@ tle them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories . &quot;
you have got to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
a food factory was created in the area whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month , to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement with 65 years , not because it l@@ acks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

first Nations @-@ young@@ sters use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; young people of the first Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they do so by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of migrant workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , the workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach adol@@ escent song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop band The North@@ star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions focus on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation took up , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in Um@@ schrift , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will take our cry .
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead of our youth
&quot; thus , they can do what the Creator has appointed for . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and inserts the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) : &quot;

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly on the menu stands , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( Raj@@ esh touch@@ stone ) , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can view these plastic courts and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend trans@@ forms them today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new plastic straps decorated with plastic gro@@ oves , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin Ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , a &quot; &quot; Kais@@ en @-@ don &quot; &quot; ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that maintains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile stand and mobile designer allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a resp@@ . salmon @-@ roe is used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decor@@ ate my mobile with salmon roe ? . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic gro@@ oves can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and handmade w@@ rist@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug tra@@ ffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , suspic@@ i@@ ons and killed killed only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; ) . &quot;
Animal pol@@ í@@ tico tells the project so :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how frigh@@ tened life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who in just one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task we have asked to go and look for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
&quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot;
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership of the international community . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug tra@@ der ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it &apos;s as if they mo@@ cked the ones who have lost someone , and those who fear that they have done something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified , that they &quot; &quot; lived &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to persu@@ ade themselves to be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district &quot; : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats for month , until they had not only destroyed the business but also destroyed their family . &quot;
you think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they are kid@@ n@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether crying would resolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez , a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who car@@ es for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , their parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men out of a driving car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence caused by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders based on the number of mur@@ ders for public security and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 . &quot;

&quot; the check factor is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or , or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to cover trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for many years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
tra@@ ilers and rear @-@ carriers
&quot; representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , which was full of people who watched the football world championship . &quot;
houses burned and sh@@ aded cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of fo@@ al bodies str@@ ung on the floor while people look at it .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was written several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
eye witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were lying in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo re@@ appeared , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the DR Congo image is only one in a series of mis@@ fortun@@ es ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; one step further , personal comments like this example mistakenly mistakenly assume the DR Congo image with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning announcement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , who gathered these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Arab news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said , monks and politicians would have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to cover this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had wron@@ g@@ ly attributed Th@@ an to this statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these wrong coupling reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) which are very similar to the image taken from DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed mask of private pages , social media platforms and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages : English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have forwar@@ ded false reports and others have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es .
&quot; we have bor@@ rowed examples of impro@@ per use and associated with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to present the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below , some examples may be used for ab@@ usi@@ ve use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be completely cle@@ ans@@ ed ( on the map in orange ) :

country examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ations of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries are pointing to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or false statements .

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of frau@@ dul@@ ent use of the picture from DR Congo , on the one hand , a twe@@ et , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted , as yet the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a verdi@@ ct on what it meant as &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ alised news and photos , international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this strai@@ gh@@ tening , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ ents that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and be used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and mig@@ rat@@ um ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news spread fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein was admitted in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article has been updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published from now on , the cath@@ olic close news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; later in connection with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the DR Congo image appeared with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States of America .
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as proof of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages related to it were not taken up in a religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam@@ ese , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Pater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , the discussion forums like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it controversial . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from the DR Kongo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos retired . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) also points to Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued by comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of mis@@ alignment and mis@@ information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and does it dimin@@ ish the real atro@@ city of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the rejection of images of a ref@@ usal is to acknowledge the tragedy . at times , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media act to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be detached from context or completely ab@@ usi@@ ve way . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international it can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ translat@@ able &quot; blog un@@ v@@ eils the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name un@@ translat@@ able ( e.g. translat@@ able ) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not at all . &quot;
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sour ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all obst@@ in@@ ately resist every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are required to precisely understand what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist by &quot; un@@ translat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ ext language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Mus@@ h@@ h you for your parents in recognition of the way around you , in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having hot on cold days in the sun .
in Birds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and want to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; , highly appreciated by un@@ translat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka changes with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya moved over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud le@@ agues . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 secure locations . &quot;
rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
&quot; Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka , twe@@ et deliver regular updates on high water situation . &quot;
many use the H@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warned Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus in the floo@@ ds , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ag@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water @-@ peg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ needed goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enter is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of Tro@@ pical Tur@@ ks Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood relief &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations . these were then transferred to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; SOS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in safety and provide help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trusted her four years old daughter , she confi@@ ded to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we are calling for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next few years , we are committed to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people ; some hold the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound by an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things are not related to you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they dei@@ oni@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit in there will be Muslim .
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 6 @-@ i ( Arabic )
I &apos;m not alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this dele@@ tion constitutes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist pictures of Muslims who have been coloni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing language is determined by the dark guy you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dism@@ is@@ sed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are continuing to ste@@ er them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty narr@@ atives domin@@ ate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
firm of the Year for Anti@@ trust Baker &amp; Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance
&quot; it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it cle@@ ars the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deeply and err@@ ingly that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children will become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia today is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to sei@@ ze the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan had re@@ designed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ challenged Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now irre@@ voc@@ able Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket gift that all Muslims contribute - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all pocket @-@ bodies with us . &quot;
we do not have to be the@@ ological experts in order to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that have been manipul@@ ated by our already f@@ law@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is . &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger who r@@ amp@@ er the head of a woman .

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Muslim , if it could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ing the Arabic verse to the protection that seals the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim community is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging is the picture of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; as they have decades winning a competition of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at that moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger , and a Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be almost man@@ oeu@@ v@@ r@@ able . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had said to me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims , as they taught me to refer to God , God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - was coloni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire &quot; which has established a company with the name of Hon@@ worthy British East Asia Company , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author of 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt for his family in India , ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he had not allowed to close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know is that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have all coloni@@ zed all the way to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was disc@@ ar@@ ded over a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ ish sub@@ missive of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ born story .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy visits the USA , and the susp@@ ects bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a fre@@ ed black slaves called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed when people filled up the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life are counting .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple strings , but fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble Bran@@ ch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to worry about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build on this two @-@ way structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and expanded with President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officials who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that con@@ cludes its borders with people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we lead , and the bom@@ bs that we cast on Muslim lands . &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell we are here today .
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically un@@ correct image and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous metap@@ hor@@ ical expression that we ste@@ ad@@ fast in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am worried because of this difficult global timing in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ miss@@ able Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story may lau@@ ern , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Berkeley building , conversations will take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people could be enth@@ ron@@ ed in the public presentation four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other , &quot; as it is my girl@@ friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , in which we have no president , who has already broken down countries and &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban variety
&quot; stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ Users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , the conf@@ using blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
the feasi@@ bility of the project is :
&quot; mass extin@@ ction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity - safe areas where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening to &quot; listening , &quot; these events are &quot; listening &quot; instead &quot; listening to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their presentation are leading to the audience . &quot;
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as if the language no longer has a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows example a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ ables , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness with a wide gr@@ in : &quot;
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were very close to me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story tours . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re @-@ determination of state debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , on 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration ; the march commen@@ ced at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ental Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was declared by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( front for the ne@@ ural audit of deb@@ ts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ release of deb@@ ts also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for deb@@ ts for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in public deb@@ ts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not the territory integrated into the state alliance - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto R@@ ican requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed from outside will be denied by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the book , which was published last year and is roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book aims to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the A@@ dra prison quarters in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that ur@@ ges his liberation , and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of times extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in cust@@ ody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police basin &quot; &quot; had taken on the basis of a command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
but his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sel &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes was more pre@@ ten@@ tious than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything in mind to wi@@ pe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world . &quot;
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; typically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dream of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually having one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a sample letter that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it is happening at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the rush of j@@ ail
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
to bring back all the moments
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in cust@@ ody since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger against corruption , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison , together with four other def@@ endants , due to contamination of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports , whose advice took place between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ election to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old post as the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the decision of the company to res@@ ign the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the res@@ ign@@ ant .
&quot; however , the company was silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be couns@@ ell@@ ors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been cut off . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paying speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
NT@@ F @-@ C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Head@@ master
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State , because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that one has rewarded somebody in such a way that has already ins@@ ul@@ ted the state so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lack the mor@@ ality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead has served solely by the state . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become we@@ ary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for ever , but also as sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years off and came free . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ates many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting .

&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or Raj@@ esh , Raj@@ esh ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese letters ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma on the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call itself hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have reviewed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair in Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ chy A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several responses to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it sol@@ ves all the posts that are suspected of demonstrating rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the words adjacent . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate language dis@@ semin@@ ates , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start using a new word or alternative notation of the cens@@ ored word in order to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to extingu@@ ish his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
&quot; when I was aware of this new gui@@ deline published by Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the Li@@ ken , Post and Share of Content for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the mail , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community to ask advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook might have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have begun this without local context or technical support and prohibited such words as &quot; Chair &quot; or &quot; Pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to recti@@ fy the fal@@ sely deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a great deal of turnover , it would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided plenty of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now am@@ using Facebook and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot was used with permission .
&quot; post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people then ? &quot;
screen@@ shot was used with permission .
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is intended to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the frau@@ dul@@ ent hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages , too . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context rather than code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad and Tobago
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country parliament adopted unanim@@ ously approved a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the aged age is 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; each person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children , who were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that between 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , eager to aboli@@ sh laws for children , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this sort of religious opposition created tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the Bill of the Bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children of children was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes for it , and not one single on the contrary . &quot;
&quot; after having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws of children were finally changed .
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
&quot; it has used too much time and unnecessary talk , which has conce@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the pedi@@ gree is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and this is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s mind was , it was definitely long enough to leave the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
the law of marriage has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; St@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft treaty amend@@ ment was approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote . &quot;
all dep@@ u@@ ties agreed to the law have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ age@@ blog@@ dab@@ lock .
many thanks to all activists who have fought for him .
heart@@ y congratulations .
a thanks to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible hook occurs in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has declared his intention to take court steps , the law should be passed , and he now seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , the majority of social media wished that there would be a different debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; rather sat , if we , instead of talking so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem that we , the state into our bedroom would invite you to be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ headed men that are opposed to them , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again . &quot;

Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia for over a month .
day by day will clarify how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many technologies @-@ sealed Internet users are acc@@ ust@@ omed to use b@@ ypass dies for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN presence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) are now displayed . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer @-@ computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is nevertheless available in spite of legal prohibition .
IP@@ FS reports in a blog post about his efforts :
&quot; having heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we all started to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought forth both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;

&quot; essentially , the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s animal world to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location in his work helps him :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to cra@@ ckle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar wants to cooperate with the authorities to achieve worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know , for he was already standing face to face to tig@@ ers , saying , &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep by sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ wei@@ ks appeared . he immediately sits down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India it avoi@@ ds women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should be ignor@@ ant of this practice . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a rub@@ bed and exp@@ elled by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married cous@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far less jurisdiction to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health staff and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and thus became the main focus of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community of video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the exploitation of patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club . &quot;
she reports on how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they keep all du@@ tiful and never ques@@ tioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider it is considered as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ ality .
&quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted , that we have never thought about this discussion . &quot;
&quot; initially Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband at the name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the panel discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; a practitioner , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy , &quot; some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anger@@ ed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she was only gi@@ gg@@ y throughout the exercise ; another decided to release the full fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner prior to the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ thy point , if he would also do it . &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with every club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to take care of who could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for many years now and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion board we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ em @-@ kur@@ t , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ ality linked to Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion lap , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; whether in the five months since her first discussion club has already changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , do it , but only when they are alone and are not a family member . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini says :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something is going to change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was found in the Japanese Twitter @-@ Trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , commented on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . alternatively , 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; is meant to represent John L@@ enn@@ on .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you definitely need to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; just today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and went over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
&quot; and of course some companies use the fan community as well as market technology , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! alternatively today is Beat@@ les memorial day . &quot;

smooth @-@ headed men are drag@@ ged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that smooth @-@ headed men could be in Mozambique &apos;s aim of attacks .

&quot; a new system of the kid@@ n@@ apping of G@@ lat@@ z@@ kö@@ p@@ sons for organ trading , pres@@ um@@ ably for deliber@@ ate purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they admit that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald @-@ headed man could reveal gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on smooth @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of killing for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 Mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the mos@@ ambique police warned about the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ y Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane , south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already rec@@ alled the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of G@@ lat@@ z@@ kö@@ p@@ sons individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for suppos@@ edly ab@@ erg@@ ing ritu@@ als , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Mozambique , which also indicates that a faith would exist , according to which the victims in the head have power to generate wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icles of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , which indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE S@@ ICH sh@@ amed a country in which the people would have embarrass@@ ed to go on the street as if they were ashamed to get sex against good grades , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os would be hun@@ ted or even their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald persons would be hun@@ ted for pur@@ pos@@ ing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both smooth @-@ headed : &quot;
mos@@ copic authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ der@@ ings of clean @-@ headed human beings .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in Arabian B@@ logger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by persons who were spending themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death but gave no further information .
&quot; the stay and the constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials found out that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we show the honour of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , so the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are torture and even exec@@ utions .
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in awareness , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to permit or to allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have cri@@ tici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway ( 1 )
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was imp@@ aired after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately failed to do anything with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon @-@ exports to China as exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ us as announced in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ itz informed that the Americans &quot; wish him to have the opportunity to treat foreign countries , in so far as he could help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Poly@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the emb@@ assy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia of her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel clearance and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and judicial system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to press the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

United States of America
&quot; German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex would over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Mexico
&quot; on June 28 , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide a proper medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; us Law@@ yer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day but the police always watched the room at the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with anyone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including the freedom of expression , and release the rights en@@ forced for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
United States of America
France &apos;s foreign ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announces that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan of Tai@@ pei
the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lator Yos@@ em@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic progress party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
it supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
no one ques@@ tioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land , we hear that we are not a country ultimately . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of this , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , as well as cities which are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re will emerge from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , for@@ sake the distor@@ ted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final effect , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he asked for appropriate questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clear his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which land belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
&quot; I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam will take the effort to clarify this point , provided that it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; announ@@ cing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critics that one should start reading the whole conference of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam can be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the inscription .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ even , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore had said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review sets the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam has &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; since it plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who does our prime minister have to pay back invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine extends to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;

screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , reve@@ aling rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series is by Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I most asked in Japan is : are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered a pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it would not matter to me , if you were mistaken for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be sp@@ iny - like the gentle , gentle , but tra@@ gically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no edges and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
to be harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; it can be good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; .

&quot; a pop band in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and despite its promises to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girl@@ friend makes .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was split 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary condition , which gives the supreme commander of the army total decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; change of settings &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised the online content and individuals accused of having accused the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict sense of &quot; Read Maj@@ esty &quot; ( maj@@ esty ins@@ ult ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ eller before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they suppos@@ edly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the song was members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; who was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ abor@@ tion war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal bas@@ ins of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked on Soviet parties in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the majority of Russians and n@@ oses live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely stepped over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early six@@ ties , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and they are rarely occupied by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that serve all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ enko , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in his hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she left the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in sub@@ sist@@ ence ( cultivation of agricultural products for own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the laps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dj@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave from Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;
aunt G@@ alya tells her that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family , and I live in this building . &quot;
when vac@@ ations are we visit us .
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; she calls her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply disappeared ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will still take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation turned towards the end , a little boy conf@@ esses us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a demoli@@ shed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now follows the ball .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw stones onto the fallen buildings . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood who care for the ind@@ w@@ dness in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez introduces a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula ; it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? .
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes outside . &quot;
she does not want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , it massages them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there . &quot;
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling the circuit together and that the Afri@@ cans speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket after Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages if they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chi@@ ckens like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spar@@ king hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , there is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blan@@ kets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after living for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his office from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to squ@@ e@@ eze money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ person who gave him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the passages , the travel@@ er quietly consul@@ ates their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who left . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ece made her a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s sad while she put her in a nut@@ shell .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , alternatively gear , juni@@ ors , juni@@ ors , juni@@ ors , ... &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10th , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification , in which they announced the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in communication with the police , the app was able to detect and trace the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web sites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports of digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and the south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often order extreme cens@@ uses and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ down@@ s . &quot;
&quot; media outlets based on Twitter , published on Twitter , published photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen ass@@ aul@@ ted the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected in a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use equipment intended for elderly people .
this is a form of bon@@ dage through the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Audi@@ China &quot; ( Raj@@ esh leap leap leap leap ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which empha@@ sizes that the software can elev@@ ate the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are connected to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all governmental branches , government bodies and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible crime rates , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six stories in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane depic@@ ts his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
everything has resolved gradually and reveals a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
one who makes all honor to her name .
one who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the storm . it becomes clear to you that you are tra@@ pped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents who have built stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my Father three times , but this was not enough so that I &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teen@@ agers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all districts co@@ vet@@ ed , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ff@@ ed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot;
I listened to my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed ourselves to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it simply interests you not in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following , no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you saw it all the way to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
and you dare to see me in your eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was due to my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father right away . &quot;
&quot; his father right away . &quot;
the st@@ ench of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I form@@ ulate all the details carefully before I manage the space .
&quot; otherwise , they have assigned me a larger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately sit , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I attacked a well @-@ tried communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; self @-@ convi@@ ct &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a resp@@ ectable middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ?
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately stop .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which refres@@ h themselves on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening , always at this time the cri@@ es ring , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; don@@ ner , &quot; reference to 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was venti@@ l@@ ated : in order to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they have played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ out and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , here is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems like this . &quot;
&quot; it cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that slip it : &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this day and protest in demonstrations that will soon find an end anyway . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I am acc@@ ust@@ omed to answering .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communications tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to myself or ill , punished , even though I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all their variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lov@@ ingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably origin@@ ates from the clo@@ aking .
your hang@@ man takes pleasure in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams weren &apos;t enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector or whether it belonged to the normal equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , which is why he reached an electri@@ cally charged bar . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ fu@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father needs to be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and walk away , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he s@@ nar@@ ls to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , sometimes back to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist , facing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned their well @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; but with his music , which often deals with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also demands the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his mind , and he can feel loud with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he fights against the US foreign policy a special rel@@ uc@@ tance . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan , and so far has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while in water , Nes@@ café sh@@ ook into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during this time , it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that food consumption is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the mu@@ ff@@ ins speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sw@@ aths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a j@@ ail in the open sky , especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ adan &apos;s water - not to land in j@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jordan &apos;s Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert table . &quot;
&quot; the MEP and former spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which ques@@ tioned the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the whole region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who still op@@ ted for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might not be simply a rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflects an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b recovered traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ or kill@@ ings &apos; has taken place in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ or kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; &quot; be imprisoned for an in@@ definite period of time in prison , &quot; &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucr@@ atic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee of the family are often necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music is also very popular and is well known for not shy away from topics that are long as tab@@ oo in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however adm@@ its that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics fails to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , het@@ ero or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to note that his comments from the context have been ri@@ pped , distor@@ ted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ as , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ it , who should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service arrested several former government dep@@ u@@ ties and members of the teacher association , with the reason@@ ing that they were cri@@ tically app@@ alled by comments in social media about the problems rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has now turned M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ less and internal changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience &quot; it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will emerge from genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bom@@ bs , spreading uni@@ tions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to rip and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big and extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the ban@@ qu@@ ets , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! # Summer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter high ra@@ vine was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans s@@ wap weapons against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , outer appearances and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drugs trading are all daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the development of more and more normal people into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy School , which is located in El Call@@ ao , have an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young@@ sters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year commen@@ cing in March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud because of love for the children , we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ Message to Gu@@ er@@ illa war@@ rior &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel disper@@ sed , aff@@ ection reci@@ proc@@ ate ? &quot;
&quot; this was exactly the question of the two young Colum@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga , from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Trust , and inspired them to write letters of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negoti@@ ation , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ illa de@@ fle@@ ction F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , forming the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; in front of colum@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors , who have lived in illegal wareh@@ ouses for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carrying their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , has become acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colum@@ bi@@ ans joined together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors in order to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 Let@@ ters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ rior , which will then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ciliation was born at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian gave the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he tar@@ ried , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed most attention . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC war@@ ri@@ ors , who now have their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities like Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art travelled to the camp to convey the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC stood up as they had done before , in order to accept orders from their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can pass through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca province , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former comb@@ at@@ ant led me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ rior who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a gl @-@ pom@@ eg@@ rower , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I spoke to him and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sad to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else about life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to join a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in sec@@ rec@@ y .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the ARC proclaimed the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injus@@ tice worked out on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just . &quot;
&quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never found heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster , and even hate people with beautiful emotions , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - also those who killed and suffered so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ía de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ o@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were made aware that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call on all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology - they can rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ ers living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that is related to the LGB@@ T@@ Q community there is not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , following reports published by the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ az@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities det@@ ecting suspic@@ ious que@@ ers and stuck them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a woman , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; ever since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her and why she moved to Moscow .
&quot; after a group had experienced Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender ine@@ quality of their country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she moved to the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he &apos;d be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents went through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was there to bring back some shopping bags from the rear seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt myself . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had everything to get along and start scre@@ aming . &quot;
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
&quot; OC Media : in which cases , were you laid - in the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month at the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running at the top without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had@@ n &apos;t changed my gender , that everything was only bad and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has broken not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luck@@ ily the neigh@@ bors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate with 95 .
&quot; after it happened the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without regi@@ stering , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about yourself , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know what hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender ine@@ quality , this is a tab@@ oo issue . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still wear inside me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid injury . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually attempt to look like the person that she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do ? those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had one and a half months in the gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut up a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and family . &quot;
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there any gay men arrested in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it wouldn &apos;t be so many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been abandoned by their relatives to put themselves to Cad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked some village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this just a sup@@ position , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in a month and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison had disappeared after their be@@ ards had grown .
there was nothing new about them since then .
they have simply taken them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , and so far there were no reports . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
seriously ! !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to the &quot; civili@@ sation , &quot; but finally brought us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me either .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one often says to children if they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC media : so , they just closed their eyes to you because they believed they were ill ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this prob@@ ing period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about mor@@ ality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people myself when I cli@@ cked the species of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
nature has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to make you laugh at your mouth , that there are no coils . &quot;
&quot; the ro@@ dents have what the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims coming to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ tions to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong rise in suicide for the past few months .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th brought the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that could arise for his family , so Ah@@ mad@@ nag@@ i &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video sharing on YouTube held the moments after having lit for themselves .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything . &quot;
he died shortly thereafter .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ mad@@ nag@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ el@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family pat@@ ters who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to feed their families on the basis of the persecution of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most productive and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to deteri@@ or@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the rate of unemployment among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k adol@@ escents now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , who are seeking a job , finished elementary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ mad@@ i men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic groups in Ah@@ ra@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recru@@ itment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab labor forces , the local Arab ancest@@ ry is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , forcing them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ihood from their home country . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ mad@@ nag@@ i and to be employed as even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activists h@@ itting alarm before the situation will explo@@ de . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ acted depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot;
added by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women - who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all Fem@@ inist * in general .
&quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I speak on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women , on black women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , in both as well as outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists choose to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men and all men any kind of skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t associate myself as a black woman whose centre is the white woman who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ ti@@ ces in her thinking , referring to the gender as well as on the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner was compl@@ aining in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an un@@ men@@ ded and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appeal to advance their ego@@ centric program .
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to in@@ struct them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from different origins a home and to distinguish itself from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism , and to join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we are black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move us into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ismus , as we ourselves rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves in this way as we ourselves are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed by the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alization after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and due to my being .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither sli@@ pped nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;

in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development led to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , fil@@ med and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on persec@@ uted , little paid sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ative . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected people .
&quot; a Police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mal@@ treatment , the ac@@ claimed display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was also useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved her ad back . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women pay ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence in general are reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the available figures are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . here also 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this will come to any woman who will not do so for physical abuse , &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the death of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal record , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year . &quot;
&quot; in August 2016 alone , journalists killed at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ take anything
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but after that she had to repent . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she bore the mental force of his side - one of the most common forms of violence against women , and at the same time the most serious recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ missive because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she liked this so long from Carlos and didn &apos;t leave it earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victim of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as Fall everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained un@@ successful and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor translation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ th ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ registered ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original design of the law is to explain fem@@ ici@@ dal to an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish harder as it is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the law of law was changed in a number of ways in order to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law that is in principle forbidden for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently illegal in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had en@@ du@@ red the bulk of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) travel costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply permit an advertisement and want to get a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
ech@@ o@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature has no adequate financial means at its disposal :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the perpetr@@ ators of offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to permit such a long ad until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again .
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed on the homepage of the forbidden paper Az@@ am@@ n , based on a resolution by the Minister of Information . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the French authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried and tried again later . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dism@@ is@@ sed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; since then , he is the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Commander of the Defence Forces , Finance Ministers , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially domestic intelligence , public freedom , including freedom of the press , to restrict and incar@@ cer@@ ate human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention by three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 was reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of having pressur@@ ised Justice of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of justice . &quot; &quot;
Facebook page : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , as a member of the editorial committee , he was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS adopted the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief at Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the information minister had given the order that &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ kat was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted for disturb@@ ance of public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and s@@ lander . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court freely spoke to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the H@@ ail sentence of his six month prison sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his one @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Chamber also picked up the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to restore Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister turned again to the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
&quot; further violations include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not ready to stop the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Iranian authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j to release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial arbit@@ rations . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of opinion and association , as well as the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research where there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop their own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious health effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go home to support the Serbian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier says as a private person .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian National Program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; I also fixed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GM : what are your opinion about the most important science topics in your country and in Africa in general ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; it has to change , otherwise we will always be recei@@ vers instead of being power . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to retreat , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit . &quot;
GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system allows perio@@ dic@@ als to make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine covering solutions for environmental issues around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of sal@@ aries he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents used not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or carton varieties . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on continues to breed let@@ tu@@ ce , but he now needs longer because his work is more and more difficult . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river would lie a b@@ oul@@ der in order to tri@@ ckle it .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ oured to not use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source ) can be inspired by the free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed their own varieties , and not immediately to sp@@ it out - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
&quot; Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible .
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed since the available gene pool , due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always available , shr@@ inking without ce@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director director of the O@@ SS@@ I , employed a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that plants like wheat are patented in even more style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted desirable characteristics - from those , by which their taste or colour improves up to such , on the basis of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders decreases through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the view that intellectual property is another bre@@ eder , as &quot; patents and protection of plant variety innov@@ ate . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ire , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
it is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources .
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as a bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , breeds its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation in mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as those operating on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they can either survive the pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be more innovative through the avoi@@ dance of plant pat@@ ters : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I always need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties within a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected against competition for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be leading in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , creates an open @-@ source seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be adopted at one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for seed breeding . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization currently has a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which planned next year will be the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has largely taken care of where and how it is cultivated , and seed systems hardly played a role in this , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have shar@@ ply cri@@ tici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains un@@ important in spite of this attack and the cul@@ mination of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities that should defend the law in order to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals , it has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored site for a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar coming from Qatar because of alleged &quot; &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada does not have access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada uses his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes for in Egypt non @-@ access websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog he built to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider at which also has a home for Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog , on the other hand , is still accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and watched a video as the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself in the blocking of the government and reflected in what it means for him : &quot;
&quot; to lock blogs is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi , and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege setting ; an arrest , an ad@@ dic@@ ted murder , pre @-@ loading at national security council , blocking blogs and any other web page for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courage@@ ous walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( A@@ fte ) , Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical testing in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at . &quot;
&quot; A@@ fte has also documented the locking of providers , through the use of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
A@@ fte reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offer . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are hit behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed from court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with cens@@ orship and who will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are quar@@ rel@@ ing .

&quot; newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the Army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ government organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio , &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ ality , etc . &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , who first sho@@ ots and asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ den more than it is used ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ acent neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the assass@@ inations pro federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia empha@@ sizes , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police ban and to permanently maintain a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux commented on one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the criteria for the designation &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio is also causing serious consequences for human beings . &quot;
&quot; this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; where a Zi@@ vi@@ list is a non @-@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; &quot; lost spheres &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
a week now it is now that the police s@@ cl@@ ed the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicop@@ ter . &quot;

to stay alive : fried Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to vic@@ tories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition assume , on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these controlled areas outside Damascus have been under si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; head of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been batt@@ ling for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gets more and more . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about plant@@ ing fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; production of mushroom seeds , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub .
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they spread mushrooms all over East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach humans the fung@@ i breeding for various reasons &quot; : breaking the si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coff@@ ees , cart@@ on@@ board , etc ) for gaining new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis zones and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for victims of fires from 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal during the week .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires have also been registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire break@@ outs , which spread to the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy took place in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , about 500,000 ac@@ res of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a alternatively ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are ques@@ tioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led an e@@ asing of the law that allowed construction activity in case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to expand after fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; these problems point to the fact that the Website of Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants sought information , or attempted to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was thus crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the server did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , lived in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the K@@ ha@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many ha@@ ara were suddenly sen@@ sel@@ ess . &quot;
the Tali@@ ban known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara came ever closer .
many ha@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; once again , he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar that were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his li@@ vel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was dominated by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we were not freezing at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that distributed food to the need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high growth rates , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the civil rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special detention centres . &quot; they are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an emergency centre if they officially submitted an asylum application - which can be submitted for months after the application of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his bound@@ less li@@ vel@@ ihood helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af merged all its savings to the establishment of a Venice host@@ al . &quot;
it was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( English : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a ha@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans operated business , among them tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen personnel mostly have refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the dining menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail , and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ bi@@ ds plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn about packaging and conversion techniques . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; citizen report : bills from Egypt allow for dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the Camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snap@@ shot showing challenges , vic@@ tories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regi@@ stering with a government authority . &quot;
users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of un@@ successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website indicating their full name and ID number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or imprisonment of a pen@@ al punishment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently under legislative as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another dep@@ uty submitted a legislative proposal that would be introduced in the tough@@ er sentence for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he portra@@ yed violence against demonstr@@ ators who fought against the military coup that had led to the presidential election of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 demonstr@@ ators arrested at the same incident , four years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management of the human rights groups failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree with an in@@ decent amount of human rights , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ cking murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in Gi@@ za spoke of the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to the pro @-@ mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested for the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tun@@ isian activists to listen to scann@@ ed documents
&quot; in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly heard on an un@@ interrupted action plan . said plan was given by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial draft bill , which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that these all un@@ just@@ ly received funds are returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ cal plans to support the legal situation look like . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press code which journalists proc@@ ure the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that registration with the full real name will be required .
anal@@ ysts suggest that this elimin@@ ates the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks . it is un@@ clear up to now how authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these regulations only selective in order to protect ci@@ vic journ@@ alism and independence .
do you then see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;

&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government exec@@ utes a list of online services that organise the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages are currently sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave up , the site was closed because it became &quot; an information source working with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey blocks the web site completely . it is with it , along with China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop swe@@ eping
&quot; following this week , the UK government is located in the middle of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance security that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until the end of May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
