<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I also grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerans and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with Republican preselection was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't get Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme bringing people from all over the world, a deeply faithful man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump had accepted his way to republican presidential candidates, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either share his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorise people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel procedure to lift a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(note: the White and Whiplash), as the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with Donald Trump's choice, however, a vast majority of the White Americas made this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps country, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican Music School of Vicente Guerrero Community in Oaxaca province have in common with the children of the Paraguaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music that is played at both places, not only has changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among the tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hustle you learn to play day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprepared instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place the parents worked in rubbish. the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Miller) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational drama of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork effectively fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in Liberia until the other coast of Africa was looking for."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly discouraged and little inclined to welcome a criminal offense of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized themselves against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to do." "Benedict Kiilu recalls, a senior citizen of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team who discovered and pursued the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia for pillaging the fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries to stop 2012 from the NGO stop Illegal fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries, who at that time displaced the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand in each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, leader of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is trapped is hidden so it is extremely difficult to detect. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles and also circulated by the snail of information between individual countries, the actions today occur in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to label ships, fishing in prohibited areas. also, suspicious rides can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network each year due to illegal fishing which penetrate East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"its practices include activities like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of fantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system," "says Long." "earlier a ship was able to fish illegal and a country could then say 'You won't run my port'."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 tests suspected of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found refugees.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers technical support to FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be ordered by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland is helping build a system that combines different levels of information. it will help FISH-i to find criminally active ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has launched the Global Fishing Watch platform with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" gather together with neighbors to get a better picture of who does what where to do, "" he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the pursuit of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships formerly confiscated without licence and had little to face with consequences, know now that they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fisher boats are buying more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries have joined forces for the so-called West Africa Task Force." "with security, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country was able to report his first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship running under false flag. and not only was the ship underway without a license and were used towing nets which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London where she writes about the environment, technique and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and spiral ratios belong to the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="201">"in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the secret of family secrecy for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">"at that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, folterer and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret services department 141 in the prison La Perla."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he commanded me to get out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barrack where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened the end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person who was captivated there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stank there was horrible... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">"and I asked myself," "How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another person?" ""</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wore eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men lay with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Close to the entrance chewed people quietly on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner, he said:" "what do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you bring me up?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero collapsed a man and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to information by survivors, the Zivilist Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla Ribera trial, was indicted by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, director of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came here is also the way on which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they were to be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - of euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'Warriors'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "war yield" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was later on the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bayonet, or perhaps military badges, which one has fought against an enemy that is fought."</seg>

<seg id="272">Go to the top of the page</seg>
<seg id="273">"but if one goes to a house and the fridge, the turntable, clothing, painting, money... steals, then this is not war yield, but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I simply don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied:" "and you, who choke cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against rage, struck me and screamed:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill yourself."</seg>
<seg id="283">That's why we don't need anyone else!</seg>
<seg id="284">This is how my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a scarf pullover. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor but he still brought clothes to home.</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense accused me of being a co-conjurer in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was anyway there to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel regrets."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. if you have children first, you realize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you have been executed during the dictatorship of humans. but why do the bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnapped children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was just decided to kill these people, but why do their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that can be done to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when the democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to remove the mortal remnants of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of - no idea where." "you will never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something always remains.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him reproaches because of all the atrocities I had to experience because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I have not killed anyone.</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejecting me, and asked me what the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they were supposedly defended, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something like that?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he answered only" "Well I'll show me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">This is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I received the first advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">"no one can reproach me that I am prejudiced, and I ended up against my own father."</seg>
<seg id="324">Luis Alberto Quijano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="325">"he was accused of 416 crimes including severe, illegal deprivation of liberty in 158 cases, torture in 98 cases, torture followed in 98 particularly severe cases, torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidnapping one of the 10-year-old child."</seg>

<seg id="346">Edited by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre where one can prolong his driving license, last month witnesses of a very unsuccessful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign, the Japanese word" Rajesh "(koreiss), which means" older drivers, "was mistakenly translated - but perhaps also with malicious backthoughts & # 8212; as" awful motorists. ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September in electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">"editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, an inhabitant Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "dangerous drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate name" "elder drivers" "(english:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for translation errors.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation)," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The japanese online news service J-Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "awful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "fearful" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents is quite a cause for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 deaths were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors were 1,803 of altogether 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"in the article published on Yahoo, the above-mentioned reporter published comments to the light that showed what prejudices some Japanese believed against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation errors was among other things the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"-" "Is that (" "dreadful motorists" ") about not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">The translation is only for help because we do not guarantee the accuracy of the contents.</seg>
<seg id="370">"-" "I don't think this is a real translation error."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills in order to understand the source text and learn active language skills in order to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, costs, or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"however, some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations themselves internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and mysterious phrases that arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique can not replace human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the Kyoto town will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began working as Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46,000 boys and girls were forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is very simple: a large family with little money transfers her inferior son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head."</seg>

<seg id="425">"in Paraguay, this practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"in doing so she spoke with Crimean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practices of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, as the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to the Crimean tas is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who has her daughter in faith that she will complete her education, improve her position in society, and" make something out of herself, "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies the exploitation with faith means that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved."</seg>

<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira stroke on Marín as long as she suffered mortal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo blurred for the girl's death deep in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest meetings and demanded that there should be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>

<seg id="457">"their brothers had to work all the way, and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she was still learning time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Fridays for example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time for learning."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she did not get endless food." "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food out of the fridge," "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"at some evenings, the owner of Alvarenga pleaded not to stand next to him and to read articles of opposition newspapers such as" Sendero "or" El Pueblo. ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the official media reports of the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"he thought it intelligently, but did not stay with her." "the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="472">"they did not often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would be" "bad habits" "there again."</seg>
<seg id="473">They feared that they would lose the education they had made them to lose again.</seg>
<seg id="474">"however, it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work."</seg>
<seg id="475">"also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against." one thing that is almost never spoken is harassment and the chicans, which are exposed to Crimean tas if they go to school. "</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and utilisation of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when accepted by the Parliament, users must register in Egypt at a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, then a place would be established which is entrusted to citizens without permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users must register with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are currently unable to register the registration at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"ISO-2022-jp (Japanese, email) euc-kr (Korean) gb2312 (Chinese, simplified) gb18030 (Chinese, simplified)"</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to construct a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they could violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically at all realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed by Parliament's legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image area," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the Tierschützerin Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards, which strikes through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian leopard is the only surviving predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and the flourishing of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to actually see a Persian leopard in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera ball, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture, in Japan, had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to escape, because the tsunami had all coastal towns disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima Prefecture also had an atomic accident, which is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (Rajaday Requiff, saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from accommodation shelters (Rajetsu juutaku) tried to relocate into final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold disaster, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 more and more people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who came home after the disaster, were moved to final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could find out, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures, the tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected large-scale production in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear plywood-zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima lags far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to be able to determine a total picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation. she asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their empathy changed towards the tsunami-risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami's consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disaster prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture also witnessed the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, moved into permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 level there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima, outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the areas of disaster, most of the evacters still in homes are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish Sugar Mills - regardless of the fact that there are no appreciable sugars on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the successive period the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier-veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that in the east of the region there are sugar cane factories, which after a long inactive time are in operation again because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembers exactly to have heard that in Mañalich would get the sugar cane mill, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests have no more news anymore."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(picture: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became untenable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories; the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of four Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the price of sugar rose again a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero. "</seg>
<seg id="653">"from then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began."</seg>
<seg id="654">"the following years saw a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closing of the factory, the word he repeats most is" scam. ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all interviewees have the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first closing year, the first letters began to come."</seg>
<seg id="661">"it was officially authored documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date."</seg>
<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was overwritten and the letters came more and more frequently."</seg>
<seg id="664">"Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the factory shut down for two years, and he was one who received the letters." the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation, "he assures."</seg>
<seg id="665">"Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for the retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma."</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will in the shutdown of the factory in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">"with every part he removed, he demonstrated one of his 31 working years."</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workstation has been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">"in many cases, no alternatives for the work places and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located were created."</seg>
<seg id="670">"we will never know if during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well."</seg>

<seg id="674">"after two years, the people of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed."</seg>
<seg id="675">"when the sugar cane mill closed, or rather, when they began to dismantle them, they also stopped to asphalted the road, disadvantaged also other farms."</seg>
<seg id="676">"without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to pick up other factories."</seg>
<seg id="677">You have got to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">"without a future perspective, many young people also left the region."</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area whose production serves not even for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">"at the end of 2016, Nene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work."</seg>
<seg id="682">"forty-nine harvests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand peso per month, to spend the years retiring in Mañalich."</seg>

<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a road section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not solved.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what exactly on the menu stands, close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (Rajesh touchstone), which is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can view these plastic courts and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend transforms them today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver matome, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new plastic straps decorated with plastic grooves, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin Refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essentials is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, a" "Kaisen-don" "(a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that maintains your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile stand and mobile designer allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura resp. salmon-roe is used, a popular topping, which is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there's someone who would say:" wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with salmon roe?. "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic grooves can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handmade wristbands from dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g." "www / gallery /". ""</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi neighborhood, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" fight against drug trafficking "in Mexico, suspicions and killed killed only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with drug trafficking ")."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político tells the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how frightened life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for secret tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who in just one day lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priest:" "as every Sunday, we prepare ourselves today for the task we have asked to go and look for tombs, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother who is here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay her out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">"the editors of" "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" "explain why the project is so important:"</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the conflicts, fragility and state leadership of the international community."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trader) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroism" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it's as if they mocked the ones who have lost someone, and those who fear that they have done something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified, that they" "lived". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to persuade themselves to be spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the capital district ": how a family was looted with threats for month, until they had not only destroyed the business but also destroyed their family."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when they are kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days, whether crying would resolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article" The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez, a Generation of Violence. ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, their parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" "Chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, saw the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men out of a driving car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence caused by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders based on the number of murders for public security and government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015."</seg>

<seg id="819">"content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to cover tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this wrong coupling of image and event -" wrong description "or" false context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked around and exploded."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for many years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">Trailers and rear-carriers</seg>
<seg id="828">"representatives of the authorities described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, which was full of people who watched the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and shaded corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" This is Nigeria. "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of foal bodies strung on the floor while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was written several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses reported drastic of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were lying in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "nobody stayed back to count corpses," "said one inhabitant to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo reappeared, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the DR Congo image is only one in a series of misfortunes; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments like this example mistakenly mistakenly assume the DR Congo image with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning announcement, published by the United Nations, those who could flee were punches, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, who gathered these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Arab news page falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar's Thein had said, monks and politicians would have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to cover this information."</seg>
<seg id="857">"the original contribution, which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017, can be called here."</seg>
<seg id="858">"other news organizations, who called AFP as their source, had wrongly attributed Than to this statement, but had not related the image from the DR Congo."</seg>

<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or for the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued by comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of misalignment and misinformation suggests that actual atrocities are untrue, and does it diminish the real atrocity of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"an argument is that the rejection of images of a refusal is to acknowledge the tragedy. at times, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers desensitize and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media act to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there are some violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be detached from context or completely abusive way."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international it can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">"a blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. translatable) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world, which are difficult or not at all."</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese sour) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all obstinately resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are required to precisely understand what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist by" untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotext language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Mushh you for your parents in recognition of the way around you, in your younger years. "</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi "- The comfort or laziness you feel after having hot on cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page and want to publish more of these" confusing "words, and show how different, valuable and impressively these little languages are."</seg>
<seg id="958">"speakers of the" Treasure Languages ", highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here."</seg>

<seg id="1156">It was declared by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (front for the neural audit of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-release of debts also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the territory integrated into the state alliance - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socioeconomic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state of state."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Rican requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of the citizens, measures imposed from outside will be denied by the people."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"the demonstration wore the name" "night watch for light and truth." ""</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is royalty-free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the Adra prison quarters in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that urges his liberation, and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police basin" "had taken on the basis of a command of the Military Court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassel's cultural prototypes was more pretentious than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything in mind to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"typically, Bassel could not finish this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dream of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually having one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a sample letter that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger against corruption, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"it is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison, together with four other defendants, due to contamination of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose advice took place between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-election to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post as the company did not complete disciplinary proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the decision of the company to resign the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a setback with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the resignant.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company was silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" disgusting ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be counsellors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been cut off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could keep paying speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be integrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">NTF-C.O.N.S. Headmaster</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza was rewarded by the State, because he insulted him, I cannot believe that one has rewarded somebody in such a way that has already insulted the state so massive."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lack the morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead has served solely by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a hand it was an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become weary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are part of Samora Machel prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for ever, but also as sharp, one-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he affirmed that" an ambitious man was able to sell, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it's not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is at the same time criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also rejected:"</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censates many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar PAE" means chickpeas or splitting.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya (Wikipedia Commons) Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or Rajesh, Rajesh (in Burmese letters) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical national movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call itself hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have reviewed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair in Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (spider bse), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboochy Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "Healing" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several responses to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it solves all the posts that are suspected of demonstrating racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the words adjacent."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar PAE". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate language disseminates, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start using a new word or alternative notation of the censored word in order to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to extinguish his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new guideline published by Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the Liken, Post and Share of Content for 24 hours, because the Post" did not meet the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the mail, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community to ask advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook might have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have begun this without local context or technical support and prohibited such words as" Chair "or" Pea curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to rectify the falsely deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a great deal of turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided plenty of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now amusing Facebook and consciously writing the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"only to try out if Facebook removes the mail, which contains the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot was used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"post states" If you are a doctor, do you heal people then? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot was used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is intended to heighten violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the fraudulent hate speech on his Burmese pages, too."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that between 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, eager to abolish laws for children, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say to the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this sort of religious opposition created tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the Bill of the Bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the country's senators gave on Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:"</seg>

<seg id="1359">"dear readers, as these audiobooks are in German, it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it has used too much time and unnecessary talk, which has concealed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the pedigree is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and this is worth almost every price."</seg>

<seg id="1377">"while the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said that it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, the majority of social media wished that there would be a different debate on the subject."</seg>

<seg id="1390">"through the mirrors of websites, Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again."</seg>
<seg id="1391">"the English-language Wikipedia page was displayed on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally."</seg>

<seg id="1394">Day by day will clarify how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technologies-sealed Internet users are accustomed to use bypass dies for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN presence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to be locked, several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated) are now displayed."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer-computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is nevertheless available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">IPFS reports in a blog post about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"having heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we all started to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has brought forth both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when it is locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him, they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours."</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry a camera with him and trying to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's animal world to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location in his work helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was and I immediately started to crackle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar wants to cooperate with the authorities to achieve worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know, for he was already standing face to face to tigers, saying,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep by sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the King of the Buweiks appeared. he immediately sits down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it avoids women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should be ignorant of this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a rubbed and expelled by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married cousin."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far less jurisdiction to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health staff and housewives, joined a unique club and thus became the main focus of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community of video Volunteers and advocates the exploitation of patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as children's marriage to exile from HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports on how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who do not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands is a custom, which they keep all dutiful and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider it is considered as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"the tradition is so deeply rooted, that we have never thought about this discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"initially Rohini, who had never called her husband at the name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the panel discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"a practitioner, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion club with this self-confidence in Baggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy, "some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angered, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only giggy throughout the exercise; another decided to release the full frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner prior to the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberthy point, if he would also do it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion with every club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to take care of who could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for many years now and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion board we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salem-kurt, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morality linked to Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion lap, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"whether in the five months since her first discussion club has already changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, do it, but only when they are alone and are not a family member."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the violets for more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we're talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "messages from those who experience themselves," "and provide a hyperlocal context in order to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(state risk), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and told a spokesman, he did not consider it as" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to permit or to allow him treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway was impaired after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately failed to do anything with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon-exports to China as exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Lius as announced in an explanation on June 30:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polyley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia of her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as travel clearance and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and judicial system, as well as international obligations."</seg>

<seg id="1665">"us Lawyer told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day but the police always watched the room at the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with anyone outside, including his lawyers."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights commitments, including the freedom of expression, and release the rights enforced for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>

<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "twist the logic" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land, we hear that we are not a country ultimately."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of this, it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, as well as cities which are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the topic, the good old lyre will emerge from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, forsake the distorted logic as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final effect, in the last week of Shanmugam, responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He asked for appropriate questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam to clear his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which land belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam will take the effort to clarify this point, provided that it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"announcing his commentary on the blog, he points out the critics that one should start reading the whole conference of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam can be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore had said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be with them or not, but that is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review sets the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"Mr. Shanmugam has" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since it plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the Journey of a Decade magazine extends to Bejahung, Singapore and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the newest part of this series is by Nevin Thompson, editor of Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I most asked in Japan is: are you Americans?</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered a polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know each other, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" nice "is basically to be spiny - like the gentle, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no edges and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"it can be good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major part of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open kindness which I connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1894">"in Mexico" Mama Africa "houses migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez introduces a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula; it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in a teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full busses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cardboard boxes outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, it massages them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a Joghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling the circuit together and that the Africans speak at Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket after Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages if they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chickens like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only sparking hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, there is a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after living for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his office from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single-person who gave him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the passages, the traveler quietly consulates their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems to be happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who left."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there are one of her daughter with African hair fleece made her a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she put her in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, alternatively gear, juniors, juniors, juniors,..."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10th, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification, in which they announced the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in communication, it is said that the app" "prevent access to terrorist information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in communication with the police, the app was able to detect and trace the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blocking pornographic web sites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reports of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and the south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often order extreme censuses and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"media outlets based on Twitter, published on Twitter, published photos of a checkpoint where policemen assaulted the inhabitants indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected in a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use equipment intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage through the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from AudiChina" (Rajesh leap leap leap leap) also released a Jingwang product description, which emphasizes that the software can elevate the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang are connected to electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all governmental branches, government bodies and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report from Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "terrorist videos". "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible crime rates, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six stories in the series" sleep or death, "in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane depicts his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing."</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has resolved gradually and reveals a truth that is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One who makes all honor to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but if reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor, the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence, even if the earth moves on the axis of the storm. it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents who have built stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they arrested me and my Father three times, but this was not enough so that I" learn my lesson, "as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar" "screams."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all districts coveted, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was silent, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been stuffed up into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had a little calmed down after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke the silence by screaming several times" "Allahu Akbar" "from my house."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I listened to my voice through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"a few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to come together."</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied ourselves to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you are aware that you liberate the spirit from the lamp, but it simply interests you not in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following, no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you saw it all the way to the office of security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan starts to say:" "let me hear how you cry" "Allahu Akbar", "or you are brave enough to cry if we are not near."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes focused on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you dare to see me in your eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was due to my foolishness, vanity, perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">"I was so sure, when I answered," I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday. "</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I've never stopped looking into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father right away."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father right away."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence is still in my nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a mental torture, which I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I formulate all the details carefully before I manage the space.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"otherwise, they have assigned me a larger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with only one more prisoner, and I must immediately sit, without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I attacked a well-tried communication method: with the fist to beat the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell-mate was a" "self-convict". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he answered me finally.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently none of the surrounding cells lay a respectable middle-aged man who looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no distinctive features can be seen on me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will immediately stop.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured me that they would release him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liar.</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would like to have had a scarecrow to drive out all these crows, which refresh themselves on the fruits in the garden of my head."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from afar, I still hear them cry" Allahu Akbar. ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 am in the evening, always at this time the cries ring, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black was the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person: the Raad (e.g.:" donner, "reference to 13th Sure of the Quran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was ventilated: in order to protect the state security from us and prevent us from exposing the traitors and the terrorists in us, they have played their confessional blackout and betrayed the narrow view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, here is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I cared for the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems like this."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"it catches a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that slip it:" my boy, you're still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this day and protest in demonstrations that will soon find an end anyway. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I am accustomed to answering.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communications tool after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to myself or ill, punished, even though I had nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">To punishment in all their variety.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably originates from the cloaking.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hangman takes pleasure in your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams weren't enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner remarked the cooling, and found no pleasure in it, which is why he reached an electrically charged bar."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-naked body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect power conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">"after two terrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night."</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which happened to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, asshfucker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of an inexhaustible youth:" "my Lord, my father needs to be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet, and walk away, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always let me go.</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he snarls to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, sometimes back to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now Hdaib is a passionate activist, facing the conservative majority and questioned their well-tried opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"but with his music, which often deals with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also demands the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his mind, and he can feel loud with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he fights against the US foreign policy a special reluctance."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation, "even though he was born in Jordan, and so far has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances," Hdaib stresses. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so because I am a man," "while in water, Nescafé shook into two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time, it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that food consumption is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the muffins speak lukewarm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a jail in the open sky, especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan's water - not to land in jail."</seg>

<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert table."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MEP and former spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which questioned the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "who still opted for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not be simply a rhetoric, but actually reflects an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib recovered traditional gender standards by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of 'Honor killings' has taken place in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch the number of Honor killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can" "be imprisoned for an indefinite period of time in prison," "and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee of the family are often necessary that the woman will not happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music is also very popular and is well known for not shy away from topics that are long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics fails to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words," that can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to note that his comments from the context have been ripped, distorted and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a machined version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuas, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuit, who should work later on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service arrested several former government deputies and members of the teacher association, with the reasoning that they were critically appalled by comments in social media about the problems rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has now turned Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtless and internal changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience "it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will emerge from genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, spreading unitions, and artificially induced democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rip and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big and extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the banquets, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literal)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drugs trading are all daily."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the development of more and more normal people into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these intricate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy School, which is located in El Callao, have an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing art instead of bad advice."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of youngsters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year commencing in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" "LiebesMessage to Guerilla warrior", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel dispersed, affection reciprocate?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this was exactly the question of the two young Columbian activists of Leonardo Párraga, from the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth-Trust, and inspired them to write letters of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the Guerilla deflection FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), forming the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of columbians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warriors, who have lived in illegal warehouses for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians joined together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerilla warriors in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 Letters - one for every former guerrilla warrior, which will then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was born at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian gave the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he tarried, he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed most attention."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC warriors, who now have their place in society and have to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the Stiftung BogotArt travelled to the camp to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC stood up as they had done before, in order to accept orders from their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can pass through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said Manuela Jiménez Avila."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a representative of the province of Valle del Cauca province, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former combatant led me through the camp of the Guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla warrior who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a gl-pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless, I spoke to him and asked," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I answer to a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sad to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else about life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to join a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the ARC proclaimed the history of the organization, its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice worked out on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never found heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster, and even hate people with beautiful emotions, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - also those who killed and suffered so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commandant in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Daría de Jesús Monove, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were made aware that after disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call on all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology - they can rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that is related to the LGBTQ community there is not only created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken over the international headlines several months ago, following reports published by the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milazina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities detecting suspicious queers and stuck them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a woman, was born in Grosny, and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"ever since childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">She became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her and why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group had experienced Chechens from the gender inequality of their countrywoman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she moved to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he'd be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents went through the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was there to bring back some shopping bags from the rear seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt myself."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechen:" how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you Schandstain? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had everything to get along and start screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which cases, were you laid - in the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time in his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running at the top without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I hadn't changed my gender, that everything was only bad and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has broken not only your family, but the whole Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window panes and a plate with 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think about yourself, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know what hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender inequality, this is a taboo issue."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still wear inside me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid injury."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually attempt to look like the person that she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do? those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had one and a half months in the gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and family."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there any gay men arrested in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been abandoned by their relatives to put themselves to Cadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked some village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this just a supposition, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in a month and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison had disappeared after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"up to now, however, they were not presented as bandits, and so far there were no reports. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to introduce us to the" civilisation, "but finally brought us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never hurt me either.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says to children if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC media: so, they just closed their eyes to you because they believed they were ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this probing period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who laughed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clicked the species of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear an Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to make you laugh at your mouth, that there are no coils."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the rodents have what the cabardines have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I am from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims coming to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitions to men who love men and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I'm going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong rise in suicide for the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed of his own helplessness that could arise for his family, so Ahmadnagi's human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video sharing on YouTube held the moments after having lit for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahraazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"Ahmadnagi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazelawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: they were all family patters who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the basis of the persecution of the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in a century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most productive and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and privation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to deteriorating the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among the Arab ahawk adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazi, who are seeking a job, finished elementary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">Systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mix of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahmadi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic groups in Ahraz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab labor forces, the local Arab ancestry is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to annihilate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, forcing them to earn their livelihood from their home country."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to Ahmadnagi and to be employed as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists hitting alarm before the situation will explode."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is unacted depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, even with intersectionals"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women - who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should be all Feminist * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I speak on skin colour, on racism, on black women, on black women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I mention how we have always been abused in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, in both as well as outside the feminist movement, many white feminists choose to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and sing" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men and all men any kind of skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can't associate myself as a black woman whose centre is the white woman who refuses to take into account injustices in her thinking, referring to the gender as well as on the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner was complaining in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an unmended and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appeal to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women from different origins a home and to distinguish itself from the white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism, and to join the movement of womanism, which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we are black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move us into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanismus, as we ourselves recapture ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves in this way as we ourselves are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered by the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and marginalization after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and due to my being.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither slipped nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa continued to travel over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan area in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," "says Musa."</seg>

<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film based in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary film."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by curative. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed for the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a Police Commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time had passed and the police said that her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena for maltreatment, the acclaimed display of Ada Báez was also useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved her ad back."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women pay ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence in general are reported to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Paraguays laws: good approach, deficient implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, a researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institute in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available figures are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. here also 86% of the ads of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this will come to any woman who will not do so for physical abuse," "she explained at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the death of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal record, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"in August 2016 alone, journalists killed at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman died due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undertake anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do it, but after that she had to repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she bore the mental force of his side - one of the most common forms of violence against women, and at the same time the most serious recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she liked this so long from Carlos and didn't leave it earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreated her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you") consisting of women who are all in some way victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias Fall everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities remained unsuccessful and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays laws: good approach, poor translation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but are not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the indication of abuse is a way of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fürth)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-registered) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law is to explain femicidal to an independent criminal record and to punish harder as it is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the law of law was changed in a number of ways in order to also win the deputies for the law that is in principle forbidden for decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently illegal in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had endured the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) travel costs, which have to bear the victims of violence at present, if they simply permit an advertisement and want to get a safe accommodation to the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echoauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature has no adequate financial means at its disposal:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates and contributes to the perpetrators of offenders."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to permit such a long ad until ill-treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law passed in the Paraguayan senate."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack its victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"however, the cancellation of the words" gender, "" political force "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law is considered a great setback."</seg>

<seg id="2552">"the Sultan's rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, especially domestic intelligence, public freedom, including freedom of the press, to restrict and incarcerate human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists."</seg>

<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research where there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop their own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go home to support the Serbian healthcare system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier says as a private person.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian National Program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"I also fixed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what are your opinion about the most important science topics in your country and in Africa in general?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"it has to change, otherwise we will always be receivers instead of being power."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to retreat, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine covering solutions for environmental issues around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of salaries he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents used not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton continues to breed lettuce, but he now needs longer because his work is more and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river would lie a boulder in order to trickle it.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding-tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavoured to not use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman lettuce of the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source) can be inspired by the free" Open Source "software, providing alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed their own varieties, and not immediately to spit out - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardized since the available gene pool, due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always available, shrinking without ceasing."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, director director of the OSSI, employed a genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suggest that plants like wheat are patented in even more style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted desirable characteristics - from those, by which their taste or colour improves up to such, on the basis of which they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is another breeder, as" patents and protection of plant variety innovate. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expire, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">It is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources.</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" we do not really create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as a breeder, we finally have no idea how plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breeds a variety, breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation in mass herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such as those operating on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they can either survive the patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would be more innovative through the avoidance of plant patters:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I always need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties within a few years", "he says." with a patent, you are protected against competition for 20 years. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be leading in" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, creates an open-source seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an open-source licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the OSSI obligation cannot simply be adopted at one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend for seed breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organization currently has a global alliance for" open source "seed systems, for which planned next year will be the official starting signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection between the Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has largely taken care of where and how it is cultivated, and seed systems hardly played a role in this," says Luby. "we are now trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports above."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities have sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains unimportant in spite of this attack and the culmination of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities that should defend the law in order to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals, it has never been as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first censored site for a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar coming from Qatar because of alleged" "support of terrorism."

<seg id="2727">Notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada does not have access to Egypt."</seg>

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and watched a video as the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself in the blocking of the government and reflected in what it means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to lock blogs is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a siege setting; an arrest, an addicted murder, pre-loading at national security council, blocking blogs and any other web page for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post items to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (Afte), Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical testing in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"Afte has also documented the locking of providers, through the use of internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are hit behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed from court against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old killed in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the Army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-government organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio," Extra "on August 16, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which she announced to set up a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexuality, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision is not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, who first shoots and asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harden more than it is used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that violence as a" war "is arguing."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to Cecília," 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"when we look at the assassinations pro federal state, Rio is in place 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"specially belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília emphasizes, has been repeating the security policy of the state for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police ban and to permanently maintain a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux commented on one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the criteria for the designation" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio is also causing serious consequences for human beings."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war. this includes entering into the territory of a" "enemy", "where a Zivilist is a non-sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" "lost spheres". ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week now it is now that the police scled the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">"in the midst of all these violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations, and the Syrian opposition assume, on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"head of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that has been battling for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gets more and more."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about planting fungi, so Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"due to the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with the" production of mushroom seeds, "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"now they have designed a" "educational farm" "for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they spread mushrooms all over East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for victims of fires from 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were raging in the north of Portugal during the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires have also been registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breakouts, which spread to the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, in Pedrógão Grande, a similar tragedy took place in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, about 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"all Portugal is burning in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata alternatively (@ a _ ataner) October 15, 2017"</seg>
<seg id="2841">Some of the twitter users shared images:</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday's protests was the demand for better preventative and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy as in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led an easing of the law that allowed construction activity in case if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval continues in the same article of the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of easily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to expand after fires of this species."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems point to the fact that the Website of Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as inhabitants sought information, or attempted to contact relatives, offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was thus crucial in this fateful weekend in October, that the server did not withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups, which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Hazara, lived in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner."</seg>
<seg id="2876">"even if his mother did not say it at that time, she knew she wouldn't see her son much longer - maybe even more."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Khab-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many haara were suddenly senseless."</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred of the Hazara came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many haara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"once again, he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself, to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was dominated by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we were not freezing at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high growth rates, but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the civil rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" suffers from a general lack of transparency. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 "special detention centres." they are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an emergency centre if they officially submitted an asylum application - which can be submitted for months after the application of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his boundless livelihood helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf merged all its savings to the establishment of a Venice hostal."</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (English: "behind Venetian luxury - a haara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of the Afghans operated business, among them tailoring, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen personnel mostly have refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the dining menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"however, Ashara's goals are far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retail, and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," said Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially women."</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else.</seg>

<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or imprisonment of a penal punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently under legislative as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>

<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he portrayed violence against demonstrators who fought against the military coup that had led to the presidential election of the elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 demonstrators arrested at the same incident, four years imprisonment."</seg>
