this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before any one of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally delivered dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if this sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has det@@ ained against Ris@@ en and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; on this move , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and s@@ cour@@ ge journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution Act , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courage@@ ous they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days in front of the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had been advised for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped on cra@@ cks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of separ@@ ating and cra@@ cking to the testimony , they could also do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secre@@ tly concerned with his telephone evidence , &quot;
&quot; as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit return , and even Rei@@ sen@@ ach@@ stan with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional sentence because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ y out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows Repor@@ ters to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do it from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet existed when ris@@ ers wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; here you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secre@@ tly , and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way of showing mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental officer , the alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warned us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data sheet of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that R@@ ich and Mi@@ ghty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has no tax ha@@ v@@ ens in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars goes to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from child days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting for the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent killer or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few , to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what is .
I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who happened in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is such that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators expressed themselves as African ministers who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; it really shock@@ ed us that all , except for a lawyer , made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client and of course nobody was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single leading politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we must change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very bitter@@ ly as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a few things started to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen demonstrations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been registered in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the U.S. and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind p@@ seudo @-@ companies .
&quot; we need leaders in the economy , who stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transpar@@ ence is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and commit themselves to ending laws this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together , we can finally finish the In@@ transpar@@ ence , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made an outlet store . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it got late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; u@@ h , how do I please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I lost there ? &quot;
a stranger sle@@ eps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , slept on to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me today hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
&quot; perhaps the people , who were sold as strangers in childhood , were actually friends who only waited to be discovered ? &quot;
when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
&quot; let &apos;s take a time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost ready , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air matt@@ resses on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ette ta@@ sted completely different because we made it for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you stick to the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thumb high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
share your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left wa@@ ist .
this quiet touch of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
could you please pro@@ claim Twitter for the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name , if he had told how he came from , like his dog or his children ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ essments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked cell@@ phones !
how would you feel if you had to give your cell phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system makes the trust crucial .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to submit negative judgement .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their reviews before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when adding a person &apos;s call -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation suff@@ ers simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can buy . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Great art work in your apartment ! I do vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you manage to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; what we did not expect , was the great deal of people who were more than willing to disp@@ el these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ authorised parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem . &quot;
for men trusted one another rightly .
&quot; if trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests had a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgment :
perfect house for travelers who are pr@@ one to heart inf@@ ar@@ ctions due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of participation conver@@ ge with money transactions ?
it is about an economic transaction .
&quot; but it is now just a &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people expose a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if there were a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visit , a group there would wait Ans@@ wer to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pent@@ ine neighborhood you have never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from scratch to share ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of sol@@ itude and isolation .
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
&quot; students , who were looking for a residence , were now available . &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were with@@ drawn . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs have been started , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger , or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it has been taught to us .
we have not rein@@ v@@ ented the wheel .
&quot; even before , hospitality had already existed . &quot;
there were similar websites before us .
why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da leaves me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we could use design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or just a delay in the f@@ use check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a g@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I was 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adjust myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , put into question , dou@@ b@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ ms sometimes brings me to tears .
I acknowledge myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later , I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , air@@ crafts flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disturb@@ ance ?
my shock turned into indign@@ ation quickly .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; I changed to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ ect . &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate course .
&quot; I remember how I knew me -- when we continued sil@@ ently -- so deeply it went out into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations who said , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t panic . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; again the war@@ nings took place : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged and defeated . &quot;
there were really sur@@ charges of mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because the people who attacked this country , attacked our country . &quot;
I have stri@@ pped the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we start ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Mos@@ ques and include mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the USA &apos;s body .
it is just the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first hel@@ pers and Olympic Games . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking lots , but not stopping terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , causing the terrorists to be the true Muslims and everyone who det@@ h their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inary world when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clause with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each priest with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m re@@ establishes the connection with God and His church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she prevented from joining the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit messages that have been reported negative about Muslims , they ass@@ ed rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at the mood against Muslims up@@ stairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to expose the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it the first but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
&quot; in the allocation of collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when is this a sealed young man out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page . &quot;
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only imm@@ oral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would be controlled by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure at the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and put my shoes off , and went into the building hall , and what I saw was holding me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred the courage and sympathy of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what are you going to choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or will you join those that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might possibly claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depth , work in a cl@@ assy mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family and they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people like an exception to rule , the rule is often broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air par@@ sing enters into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of air machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six metres high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting to each other , air devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also construct self @-@ prop@@ elled structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; piston 7@@ 0,@@ 5mm &quot; &quot; Wis@@ eco &quot; &quot; forged piston ( 3@@ 80@@ M@@ 0@@ 70@@ 50 ) &quot;
an air@@ plane trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
a limitation of h@@ edge @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il such as wind arches .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ plane does not matter in which location the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known around as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remotely controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ der . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inn@@ ate , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross rests , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flies , I have to take it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when I see all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is outer symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the proper ability , &quot;
moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , al@@ beit limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half of it fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took stock micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the very safe machine , on the other hand , wants to be on Broadway a flying lamp shade . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns was transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
for this short moment they gle@@ amed bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we arrange the events first in time .
billions of years ago had just emerged in the world of multi @-@ zel@@ liges .
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a giant laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that arise through colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them considered it mad .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- gravity @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which considerably improved detection performance . &quot;
this is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clear some minor , persistent issues . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my father &apos;s sick father .
&quot; in essence , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ru@@ ff@@ ling in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lectur@@ ers in courses of rel@@ ativity often perform a really sil@@ ly dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and punched by the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in construc@@ ting such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
this is quite handy . for so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
in the case of sounds it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you a lot : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ mer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make any simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the grav@@ itation can tell us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu is wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu *
it is a kind of movement of movement im@@ pregn@@ ated into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render No@@ ise &#93; somebody who knows what he needs to hear , recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
there is the remaining importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or in principle -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the thr@@ illing physical processes occur however , in the nucle@@ us that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own lumin@@ ous light . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt , which we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o they observed are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o enables us a completely different angle of view to the events of space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I ta@@ sted an experiment .
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear was eliminated . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my to@@ dd@@ les .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from there I s@@ wear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I feel very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magic effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things out , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
dre@@ am@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I create television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
each con@@ sign@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; one new episode once every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programmes , 70 hours of TV , three epis@@ odes : horror , 15 epis@@ odes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the C@@ atch , 70 hours of TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series runs on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 tel@@ ev@@ isi@@ ons are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not just produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that are burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dre@@ am@@ job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you can understand that I don &apos;t just go around on the computer and get more fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spiration -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
when I am deep@@ ened into my work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as if you have a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the tot@@ ter . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a sum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could forever drive on it . &quot;
many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the hum@@ ming -- when I started working and working with television , when I started working and working together , I discovered this cause , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the hum@@ ming is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you cannot asp@@ ire differently from the size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than aiming for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more broad@@ casts , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more I write history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the big sound , the tot@@ ter , the tot@@ ter , the tot@@ ter . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sw@@ amp .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the sw@@ amp stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned . &quot;
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that her M@@ um is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there but you can write my N@@ anny .
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ an .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped . &quot;
the sum@@ ming of the engine st@@ umps .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my tot@@ ter was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same tit@@ an work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no repentance , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium be@@ eps not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pioneer Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sw@@ amp and the sum@@ ming was me .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l you , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you are doing it , you &apos;re working , you love what you are doing , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , one painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , one painter , Bill Gates , one loves another and that gives one the sums when one stops the sums when the sums are stopped , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things are made aware of :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I hate it when I &apos;m titanium and my hum@@ ming stuff , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the tot@@ ems come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a hum@@ ming . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no secret . no secret . only love .
it is something we forgot .
&quot; the sums , the working sums , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I &apos;m describing through broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ ming is . &quot;
the sums are not effective and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on pleasure .
the real sums are dependent on love .
the hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real tot@@ ter is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be imposed , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real sw@@ amp is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this for a firm rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as simple as working .
the truth hur@@ ts
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of man is better working than being a house ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; titanium &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we are racing in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always take my phone .
= &gt; Trans@@ formers R.@@ I.@@ D .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe meet me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to playing ?
you can also ! say yes whenever your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
it is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie will be replaced .
&quot; and when my te@@ ens speak with me for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more does not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a bit !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no dist@@ ra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are included !
&quot; my children are my sympath@@ etic , my world . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children .
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; just for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the track , why not treat yourself for a full 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sw@@ amp ; the sums are not me ... no more .
&quot; bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends . &quot;
this is my h@@ um .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work are part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s up to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan Poker that is going to go to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lively , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel like this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
this is the dream of this job .
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent and severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; they are certainly one of the most well @-@ known , known as &quot; &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the inter@@ rup@@ tions of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain will be weak and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to l@@ essen the relief of the skull . &quot;
you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of disc@@ arding the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environment to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology lessons , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slowly divided and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they are from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and they then mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the t@@ apping point of the same individual . &quot;
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we tear these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we tear the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we had an injury and stim@@ ulated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
here we could of course not stop .
do these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured in the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spont@@ aneously reg@@ ained up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some extent , just as with the ape . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the mon@@ key had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the mon@@ key who spont@@ aneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we have planted the cells , see the same mon@@ key , two months after plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to im@@ plant them to humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain is giving us the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to study this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant she really is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ti@@ ghtness .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group believe in error , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are ste@@ ep@@ ed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to draw attention to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
we all recognize the debt mountain .
yet few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that is part of the wealthy sl@@ ums and corporations , but are too scar@@ ed to invest where it would be productive and income that people desper@@ ately need , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the last 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro area , in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; USD 4 tril@@ lion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to blo@@ t except the stock markets and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital form the twin tops , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that would be feared by the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest , in which they don &apos;t invest . &quot;
&quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead him to kill him . &quot;
this is my shar@@ per with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and naturally slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error to reduce the importance of ath@@ ic democracy on account of these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the poor poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , giving them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of state debt . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle that lights up very bright , it is also burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; since the time when this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies in which the economy slowly under@@ mines its policy and dis@@ ma@@ stered it . &quot;
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because the government can be in the government today and still not in power , because the power from politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ k with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is roughly like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably nour@@ ished the animals of which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ ani@@ zed the policy that it is itself har@@ med by the economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the economic demand collap@@ ses and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of hum@@ ank@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and business again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains the control , just like in antique Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in antique Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin @-@ peaks become higher , the waste is lifted , and social conflicts are deeper , just as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we must therefore shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or by something that is similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; to indul@@ ge in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital is working to you from a workplace to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income derived from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
&quot; no more distinction between capital and labour , but not a large gaps between investment and labour , not a large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no upwards tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal , in which they prefer privileged people , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but above all else , it is a world in which we can present a real democracy . &quot;
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing this not , technological development will generate such a massive drop in macro@@ economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry S@@ umm@@ ers as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely un@@ ra@@ vel . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you think from the view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sector of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I may say it so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; remember -- we tend to connect Liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
liber@@ alism and liber@@ als such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ elling enormous after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I susp@@ ect that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good@@ bye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive rejection of the euro@@ zone was proce@@ eding and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- who , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ote their den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be delayed for a while , but when the changes happen , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you anticip@@ ate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any Minister who claims to be in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they just wanted to bring our government down just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the corruption that passed through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been running a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy was : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake .
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the fre@@ ed fle@@ eing forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to sm@@ ash the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be equally unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy did three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ gehog and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select anything .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the re@@ distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; they are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ ted , where after having watched a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on average exc@@ itation , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon puts things out for nothing , do you access , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
you are being watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 - so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team watched the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has suffered a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis does not work , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we are more and more att@@ acking statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it you are in j@@ ail .
&quot; if someone is in j@@ ail here in the US and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an dism@@ iss@@ al occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are created . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced firms are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predicted through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a big news sensation . success was cul@@ min@@ ating in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked f@@ law@@ lessly , year around year , until it suddenly worked no more , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flows into decisions of life - at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics - an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy . &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the items ; as a second place you put the items together in order to make a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts together and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of , but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compet@@ ed for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; This is what the data say to us . &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
thank you ...
&quot; before there were data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ encing it later with a technique demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not alter the basic structure .
perhaps the ball will be wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right bend .
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays out to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
