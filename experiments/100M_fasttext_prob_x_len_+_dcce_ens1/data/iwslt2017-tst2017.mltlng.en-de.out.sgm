<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before any one of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally delivered drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if this sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has detained against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this move, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and scourge journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution Act, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days in front of the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had been advised for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped on cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separating and cracking to the testimony, they could also do their digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly concerned with his telephone evidence,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit return, and even Reisenachstan with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA-Whistleblower and Risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional sentence because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows Reporters to handle the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do it from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet existed when risers wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"here you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a way of showing misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental officer, the alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warned us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data sheet of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that Rich and Mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]"</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has no tax havens in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars goes to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from child days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting for the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent killer or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few, to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans who happened in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but due to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is such that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators expressed themselves as African ministers who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"it really shocked us that all, except for a lawyer, made suggestions on how to transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client and of course nobody was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leading politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we must change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very bitterly as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite a few things started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen demonstrations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been registered in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the U.S. and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need leaders in the economy, who stand up and say," Intransparence is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and commit themselves to ending laws this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally finish the Intransparence, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made an outlet store."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It got late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said:" uh, how do I please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what have I lost there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, slept on toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people, who were sold as strangers in childhood, were actually friends who only waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost ready, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham Omelette tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stopped."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former mate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you stick to the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your unlocked mobile phone to your left waist.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please proclaim Twitter for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name, if he had told how he came from, like his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked cellphones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system makes the trust crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to submit negative judgement.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their reviews before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when adding a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation suffers similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one can buy."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" "Hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request will not be accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Great art work in your apartment! I do vacation with my family." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you manage to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not expect, was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dispel these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unauthorised parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trusted one another rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests had a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart infarctions due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of participation converge with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic transaction.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just a" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People expose a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if there were a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visit, a group there would wait Answer to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pentine neighborhood you have never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">"students, who were looking for a residence, were now available."</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs have been started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger, or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it has been taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"even before, hospitality had already existed."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we could use design in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the fuse check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee-lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A gull-fitness fanatic</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," Why do you suppress yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I was 17-year-old felt to adjust myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, put into question, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythms sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I acknowledge myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you fully understands and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later, I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking news." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, aircrafts flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed to the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..." "..." "in the name of Islam...", "..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I knew me -- when we continued silently -- so deeply it went out into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said," Be alert, "" Be careful, "" Abide in well lit areas, "" Don't panic. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"again the warnings took place:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims, dragged and defeated."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surcharges of mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who attacked this country, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have stripped the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we start? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Mosques and include mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the USA's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is just the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first helpers and Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking lots, but not stopping terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other faiths more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing, causing the terrorists to be the true Muslims and everyone who deth their behavior and ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginary world when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clause with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Sacred Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. each priest with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam reestablishes the connection with God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she prevented from joining the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if you submit messages that have been reported negative about Muslims, they assed rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at the mood against Muslims upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public in order to expose the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well-informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the allocation of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when is this a sealed young man out of my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would be controlled by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we rode silently, with high pressure at the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and put my shoes off, and went into the building hall, and what I saw was holding me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred the courage and sympathy of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you going to choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air parsing enters into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of air machines in the FRAC Centre in France built a six metres high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also construct self-propelled structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>

<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can float, and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedge-starters is that they react sensitively to turmoil such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airplane does not matter in which location the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known around as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots could fly remotely controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern ruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinnate, the mechanically simple remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross rests, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and move everywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to flies, I have to take it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right when I see all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is outer symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half of it flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took stock micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"the very safe machine, on the other hand, wants to be on Broadway a flying lamp shade."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns was transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they gleamed brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events first in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Billions of years ago had just emerged in the world of multi-zelliges.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided to build a giant laser detector from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search for gravitational-waves that arise through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered it mad.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometer- gravity-wave-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which considerably improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clear some minor, persistent issues."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my father's sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ruffling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when crossing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers in courses of relativity often perform a really silly dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and punched by the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in constructing such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds it's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you a lot:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make any simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu is wu-wu-wu-wu-wu *</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement impregnated into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender Noise] somebody who knows what he needs to hear, recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the remaining importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or in principle -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the thrilling physical processes occur however, in the nucleus that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own luminous light."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the help of gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt, which we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo they observed are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo enables us a completely different angle of view to the events of space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a new generation of observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tasted an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my toddles.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I feel very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magic effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things out, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for adding 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each consignment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"one new episode once every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programmes, 70 hours of TV, three episodes: horror, 15 episodes: show To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series runs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 televisions are broadcasts I have created myself and not just produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that are burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard whether you're running a company, a country or a classrooms, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you can understand that I don't just go around on the computer and get more fantasiere, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened into my work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you have a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the totter."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a summing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could forever drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the humming -- when I started working and working with television, when I started working and working together, I discovered this cause, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you cannot aspire differently from the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than aiming for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more broadcasts, the more work there are, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more I write history."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the big sound, the totter, the totter, the totter."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the swamp.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the swamp stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overloaded, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her Mum is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there but you can write my Nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titan.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The summing of the engine stumps.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My totter was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same titan work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no repentance, nothing delegate, a titanium beeps not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pioneer Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the swamp and the summing was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl you, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you are doing it, you're working, you love what you are doing, a banker to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a banker, one painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a teacher, a banker, one painter, Bill Gates, one loves another and that gives one the sums when one stops the sums when the sums are stopped, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way outside, late and she says:" Mama, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things are made aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" kittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I'm titanium and my humming stuff, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says:" "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of humming, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The totems come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a humming."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No secret. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working sums, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I'm describing through broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real summing is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not effective and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums are dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The humming is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real totter is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to be imposed, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real swamp is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this for a firm rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as simple as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what kind of man is better working than being a house?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" titanium "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we are racing in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">= &gt; Transformers R.I.D.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe meet me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever listen to playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say yes whenever your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you think me naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teens speak with me for about 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more does not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can take 15 minutes, even in a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are included!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my sympathetic, my world."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children.</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" just for everything I've given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the track, why not treat yourself for a full 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the swamp; the sums are not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">"bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my hum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work are part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's up to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan Poker that is going to go to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lively, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel like this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things out, I awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job.</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'yes' to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent and severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they are certainly one of the most well-known, known as" "deep-brain stimulation." "it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the interruptions of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-Traumata the brain will be weak and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to lessen the relief of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of discarding the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environment to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François managed."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology lessons, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly divided and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we implanted them at the tapping point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we tear these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we tear the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we planted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury and stimulated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could of course not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured in the motor-motor area in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously regained up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some extent, just as with the ape."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we have planted the cells, see the same monkey, two months after plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, such as Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them to humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain is giving us the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials in humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to study this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant she really is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging tightness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group believe in error, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy, our societies are steeped, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to draw attention to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin-summit Paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain.</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that is part of the wealthy slums and corporations, but are too scared to invest where it would be productive and income that people desperately need, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the last 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the euro area, in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"USD 4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulate in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to blot except the stock markets and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin tops, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that would be feared by the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest, in which they don't invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">"involuntarily, the circumstances lead him to kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharper with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and naturally slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error to reduce the importance of athic democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in athic democracy was and is that it withdrew the poor poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, giving them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of state debt."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that lights up very bright, it is also burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"since the time when this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place in our present democracies in which the economy slowly undermines its policy and dismastered it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because the government can be in the government today and still not in power, because the power from politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my shark with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is roughly like a herd of carnivores that sustainably nourished the animals of which they feed, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has so far cannibanized the policy that it is itself harmed by the economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, the economic demand collapses and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and business again, and it would be better if the" demos "retains the control, just like in antique Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in antique Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, automation lets the twin-peaks become higher, the waste is lifted, and social conflicts are deeper, just as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we must therefore shape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we are democratizing the unified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" matrix "appear like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"therefore, the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" Matrix, "or by something that is similar to the society in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "to indulge in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital is working to you from a workplace to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no more distinction between capital and labour, but not a large gaps between investment and labour, not a large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no upwards twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a unified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal, in which they prefer privileged people, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all else, it is a world in which we can present a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... doing this not, technological development will generate such a massive drop in macroeconomic demand, which is called Larry Summers as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely unravel."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you think from the view of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sector of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I may say it so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"remember -- we tend to connect Liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism and liberals such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smelling enormous after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspect that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the permanent denial that a massive rejection of the eurozone was proceeding and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- who, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to denote their denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be delayed for a while, but when the changes happen, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any Minister who claims to be in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the school programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government down just because they didn't want to deal with the corruption that passed through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have been running a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika's troika who imposed this policy was: "that was a colossal mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the freed fleeing forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be catastrophic for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to smash the path of a postmodern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will be equally unbearable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy did three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technique, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the redistribution of over 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"they are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" "Game of Thrones," "" The Wire "-- all the shows that addicted, where after having watched a season, your brain asks," Where are more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts on average excitation, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon puts things out for nothing, do you access, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are being watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican U.S. senators. ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," "Alpha House", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 - so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team watched the existing data on Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has suffered a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should be able to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis does not work, this is a bit scary because we live in a time where we are more and more attacking statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the US and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an dismissal occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could be predicted through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a big news sensation. success was culminating in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year around year, until it suddenly worked no more,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data flows into decisions of life - at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the items; as a second place you put the items together in order to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been capable of, but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards "is not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say," This is what the data say to us. ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thank you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there were data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fencing it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Perhaps the ball will be wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right bend.</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays out to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
