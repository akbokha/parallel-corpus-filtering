Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t chapel that is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ time basis of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days .
it is anno@@ ying when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but very informative . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich that one recogni@@ zes as such .
&quot; more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ination She@@ ets &quot; , &quot; were incorporated into the large picture postcard . &quot;
these were based on data from the Bavarian distribution administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and origin@@ ate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ l War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the Nei@@ gh@@ bours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavarian map . &quot;
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward and founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Palace Department .
the statement sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub @-@ send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 card .
&quot; Send@@ ling was included 21 years after the map was created , in 1877 , in the district of Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , sub @-@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming a smaller one appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered pipes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pri@@ mor@@ dial &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Lower @-@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the Venti@@ lation &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with ma@@ dness . &quot;
ISO @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyr@@ il@@ lic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) mac@@ intosh ( Mac@@ Roman )
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended up buying the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he for@@ bi@@ ds the staff to use force against in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; there was room for 280 patients , later extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ro@@ ren@@ um in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , is located there . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , you@@ ths meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um Munich . &quot;

&quot; in 2015 , the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural style based on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II in bom@@ bing attacks . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked by 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; Main Place &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies had a lot of holes in the inner city in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days took place and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony took place for the second subur@@ ban rail . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the National Federation for the Promotion of Col@@ ours has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the State , as a series of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based inci@@ dents occur lat@@ ely throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , which disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately on minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people pass .
&quot; they are arrested or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline any more during the journey and was taken cust@@ ody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General State Prosec@@ utor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , where it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view to further race profile . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lat@@ ely stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ zau@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U member Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have acquired a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ demann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CD@@ U association were met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ demann first granted insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is for him the alternative commerci@@ alization path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the gr@@ ass@@ land care for a lot of work , much must be handled with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not lead bio @-@ operations . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy about the promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
one hopes that the for@@ estation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism for funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; the exposure area is therefore 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the ship@@ ments were promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers had to spend 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot;
&quot; Peter White also stated : &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ to @-@ state support of f@@ ences .
the goal is the holding of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of a convey@@ ance indicated by the L@@ PR .
&quot; moreover , the enclosed area must not be trac@@ eable ( slope incl@@ ination of 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the exposure area corresponds to 35 hectares , calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
the White House of Tr@@ ump is now accepting the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Sad@@ dam Hussein at the Fir@@ a Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic asylum in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not grasp the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have laugh@@ ed him if he had done it .
&quot; but it appe@@ aled to its significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta insi@@ sted , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem to which you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is correctly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the ra@@ ging words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who long for free to breathe free , the el@@ ding tr@@ ash of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ end gar@@ bage &quot; on our screens was better seen .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
&quot; Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to switch it back from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one , but rather an early neo@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going on . &quot;
it is to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something quite unusual here .
the importance of the statue is entirely a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usi@@ ve , but hop@@ eful men after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not supposed to ligh@@ ten the path , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when only two Schot@@ ten were part of the team of Great Britain
&quot; Director of Athletics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry it on until we find out , &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidate , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h did quite naturally were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in its fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that have been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this road , and last year has set five British and two European records . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also join the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on platforms . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this kind of home support and benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there .
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers smote him for anything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked in the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ose employees have blocked and deleted the contributions from at least 450 people , expressing their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ ended it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the Gover@@ nor dism@@ is@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rig@@ orous compliance with the principles .
he was also very ade@@ pt to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of people who come to the govern@@ ors page - which is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post Ho@@ ose Spe@@ aker A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ing people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just true people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was un@@ crowded , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I kindly agreed that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same topic , then they are more likely to be regarded as a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ t@@ orials and to arrest and arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
&quot; ISO @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) g@@ b@@ 23@@ 12 ( Chinese , simplified ) g@@ b@@ 180@@ 30 ( Chinese , simplified ) &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County complet@@ es the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Court James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable porn had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers spread between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck at his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who cri@@ tici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , who was left next year in Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round , was connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Zar@@ vad@@ i . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry did a great job when he settled this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year .
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year returns to the promotion on the home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad that it has gone so far .

less lung cancer through Passi@@ ve smoke
fewer people have died in lung cancer over the past two decades .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Home leader Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; said the director of the courtyard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the underground is much bent , which is not marked in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which is constantly ham@@ pered by construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and butter@@ flies is already enormous , &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina de@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the cro@@ pped dum@@ plings with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands are removed and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ ft floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example wash clothes with water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy and there are soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in advance of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta Government , which maintains control over the region and foreign journalists or ob@@ servers exclude them . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea into the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from cor@@ rugated shelves that were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skir@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ as Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollar . &quot;
&quot; these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a sti@@ cky presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars on a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal high@@ lands in the 1970 @-@ s were committed to genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Committee .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we call All &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular following another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week inci@@ dents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the most popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight to stop here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ native , who went to work in the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - cost her market .
&quot; the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , anticip@@ ating that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out there and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers drag@@ ged on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took offen@@ se on her tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their ri@@ fle pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ an Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten to fall into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military commander in order to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial fighter @-@ arches and carried the orph@@ an dance - in a circle constantly and a bird song im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to cast bricks on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ f was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ on spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &quot; fil@@ tered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto spoke in October 2016 that he establishes an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the integration of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5 , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it was alleged that 11 cases of violations of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been settled , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims met such alle@@ g@@ ations with fierce un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai have fear of discussing the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ f , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , such as TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army asser@@ ting to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by cont@@ acting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders are from P@@ ani@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into cust@@ ody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : mostly not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of P@@ ani@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although rare permission was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the representative Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
a lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neigh@@ bors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific countries demanded - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua would probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; said Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tri@@ bal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the families of the P@@ ani@@ ai shot @-@ victims performed a last symbolic act of the de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ ses of a victim were buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they will never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; said Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which swe@@ eps in only two years through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; said an inhabit@@ ant who named George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil defence authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those concerned .
&quot; the incident can rev@@ ital@@ ise questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
&quot; investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , outer covering for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police told them that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only to two winning sets , w@@ afer @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also very appreciated , remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote was , after many consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal came to bring the fin@@ als to a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future be the host right in the next round .
&quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ ers , the requirements regarding exercise grounds etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official press appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 American travellers are bringing banned objects to the plane , finding out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers resulted in more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ inten@@ tionally prohibited items at the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent holding the aircraft while wearing acci@@ dentally b@@ lat@@ ted kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered that they had acci@@ dentally travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , - also noted that younger travelers prefer to ignore the rules . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the most common items , which were visi@@ bly passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent stated to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male ques@@ tioned also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said it surv@@ ey@@ ed travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods had brought by airport security , and how many would have done inten@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uncertain about which fluids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Inves@@ tig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
&quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he has so far under@@ gone that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ umph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k will for the first time betra@@ y another , less splendid number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now adm@@ its : 6@@ 3,000 were already with@@ drawn from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
&quot; during a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation Payment &quot; &quot; completely back . &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are taking place , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 - all models will be - 500,000 , by 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 bookings per day .
&quot; who today orders a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; must be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if it comes to larger delays , the non@@ committ@@ ment of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from run away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt rec@@ edes the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities in comparison to previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a deadline that ran for States on October 1 , in order to comply with the standards of 2015 for floor level o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations to resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the post@@ age regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator viol@@ ated its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt stepped forward that its turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards simply increased the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ lment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet dead@@ lines for carrying out and then expected to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and agreed on an agreement for the execution , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ ended the EPA for more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take fri@@ ars seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA opinion that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; power to delay and all other legal powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive set of o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
&quot; Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , a member of the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General , who led the coalition of the states compl@@ aining the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about the sudden change of course .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests .
tum@@ ult celebrates 750 years of St Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 16.@@ 30 at a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ line to their concerns .
Walter Martini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in a document in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ customer @-@ book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ ster &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , in addition to the former parish church , in addition to the former parish church , there was also a marvellous court , belonging to which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not vice versa . &quot;
so people lived there too .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Freuden@@ stadt district of 18@@ 58 , next to the village and the Ober@@ dorf that is still visible in the village of Tum@@ bled , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the man@@ orial sett@@ ler of the village . &quot;
ancient maps from the period around 1600 confirm this historical situation .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church , and was able to bequ@@ eath his church . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two mer@@ cies on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were pl@@ agu@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops placed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; by 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the church was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 a storm broke the tower and half collap@@ sed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
&quot; the organis@@ ers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ line on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is made by the Combo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers are presenting the fantastic view . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius system that is of importance for tum@@ ors and horns .
friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ r are particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to be insp@@ ected by wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim per@@ si@@ sts &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the country council . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; association is called upon by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind power plants could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , a wind @-@ power @-@ concentration camp existed . &quot;
&quot; in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; par@@ asi@@ fication &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette for a few days before , but it had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf because of a mistake . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to decline . &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council has again decided the concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , a approval from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point , the distribution of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; the relevant letters have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to stop . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the reason@@ ing of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four per 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen had been involved in cash , has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered , which corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ person households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; in the past summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ trat gave a green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a fatal accident .
two more people were slightly wounded .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; following police indications , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car was driving the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person . &quot;
city and dealer planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ theim and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping m@@ umm@@ el in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers for which offers the private city has to store away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal and commercial associations cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
this means that the commercial association and the city enter another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sold @-@ on Sunday , talks with all business professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the city centre when shopping .
&quot; at the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it is true that with a network to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which partly spread , König had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen informed that the third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day on the nation@@ wide third is to take part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote appreciation of local trade and make its importance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own business environment .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction work it came to an explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in an explosion in the U.S. City of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others have been wounded , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed .
a first missing was later also saved as dead .
among the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as an accident , the authorities pres@@ umed work on a gas pipe . &quot;
only a few people stayed in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
Tr@@ ump continued after perfor@@ ated tran@@ scripts from telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked in a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President compl@@ ained that he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . re@@ port@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; This is what you cannot say to the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to leave Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia should be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; dump &quot; after it had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
Schrei@@ e torn the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene played on 22 July is only a post@@ age . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everybody in the audience threw a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , Om@@ bud@@ sman came back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were taken by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody has ever been charged with murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post @-@ job . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State Georgia and a life long civil right .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community , that an injus@@ tice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a place of jurisdiction puts a blan@@ ket on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI documents received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the free foot for decades , citizen rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com presented a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our of the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they removed from the j@@ ail and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , eliminated evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an election massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
&quot; almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vi@@ vi@@ dly , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many believe that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or listen to what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest Black - pushed into a room and listened , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; the actors Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines on the other side of the room . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , scre@@ aming H@@ ester and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , van@@ ishing from my property ! &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least every black actor ) breaks in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ch@@ ick . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compani@@ on@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it shar@@ ply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman dressed in sorrow , stands above the body of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays gra@@ zing pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen audience wi@@ pes per@@ spiration and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost ev@@ enly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
you have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as strong moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial place of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ sey .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children sitting at their heads , record the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe down their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience will join the actors for dinner . &quot;
at a table a white pair of Atlanta tou@@ red with a black pair that they just got to know .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today , this is called only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s court holds Broo@@ ks court on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds us of civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ age is inspiring in a way , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

&quot; the turn@@ table ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner along with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;

the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team .
&quot; he had to leave a pipe concert in 2013 , five years later , big jubil@@ ation in which the scattered &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went down . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience had grown together with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding for its view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work at several locations in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Fur@@ niture Market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the Fur@@ niture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have made Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus perhaps also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
in the winter semester I will start my studies in social work .
I will study dual studies probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different places of use during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where to play his FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the old home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works .
different from a degree in civil engineering ?
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people in front of the head , each of which have a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been brought out of the family - one must always deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .

Pear@@ son cuts another 3,000 work@@ places and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business . &quot;
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure with which the company was faced . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 places have already been lost . &quot;
Pear@@ son announced a plan to reduce cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 39@@ 4 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning .
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after a increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds was achieved in the first half of the year . &quot;

&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killing a soldier of NATO and several other injured , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured and divided a statement by N@@ ato .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to be attacked as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a suicide bom@@ b@@ shell killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ i@@ tic district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops displac@@ ed the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and in particular to the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA re@@ counts decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by col@@ lagen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are committed to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ stipul@@ ations 2015 &quot; &quot; and said that it is showing the Agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue and that we are respon@@ ding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone conditions in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ O site says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce the lung function and can ampli@@ fy respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipal coun@@ cils want common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the district council of Flu@@ te @-@ Win@@ zeln decides the establishment of a joint room in the future senior residential community . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the area is still owned by the church community until now , there is no plans for planning a project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion on a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the Municipal Council are ho@@ ver@@ ing to fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting point just for the residents of the sen@@ iors , but openly to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; k@@ art café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been selected last autumn by means of funding .
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a b@@ ill@@ ar between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings - which reduces the pitch and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , this is not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as it comes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call points to the many buildings that you don &apos;t like to move forward , but now you rest at the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsi@@ dy but will receive a real surplus value that is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter@@ title . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to apply the proposal , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that sum@@ mar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
colli@@ sion with car : Rad@@ ler is flung on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth was captured by a car and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road along the road of the Schwar@@ zer Route from Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously didn &apos;t care about the traffic . &quot;
he met with a car steering a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ de@@ erin .
the man was thrown out onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return car .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago

&quot; with personnel , the FC Bayern will be travelling for the first mandatory play of the new season to Dortmund . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
personnel care at the German football record master Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ren@@ ounce the BV@@ B with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; they are also missing Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the last six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the Harz mountains walk to Stern
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
there is a planetary travel in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the needs of many har@@ z@@ visitors . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association intends to achieve &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
result : passed Address : encoding : ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 1 ( detect automatically )
the information on the tablets should be added via the internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star path is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ path the viewer experience much worth knowing , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more light than another , although it was far more distant . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association runs the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Society of Sup@@ por@@ ting Society Plan@@ etary Go@@ ett@@ ingen , there is something similar to the planned star - the Plan@@ etary Trail . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet goes along with its stel@@ ae up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ ele with the individual planets - including the down@@ ward degra@@ ded P@@ lu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres long and measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to the P@@ lu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a colli@@ sion course in order to stage the most exciting competition in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ folded World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down cor@@ ridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia reached the right hand and said , &quot; How are you champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
he def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple met for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as commented that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended to Bron@@ er , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he must move to light weight men &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound Debut this year , in order to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight competition in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and then openly expressed himself on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may be able to participate in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko spoke at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks , the three combat champion from River@@ side &quot; very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show the impact , then boxing . &quot;
they both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
this is the battle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded after tire @-@ bur@@ ners
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was losing control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car drag@@ ged to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then lying on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service the A7 was closed towards the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
found this to be one of the fastest ways to get a gallery on the web . thanks .
&quot; after the 2 : 2 in the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points brings points . &quot;
&quot; with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was pleased with the result , but would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two enemies too much , and we have to get better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain should also be optimised further .
&quot; and a gate after a free fall , the For@@ tun@@ en also no longer want to capture . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better even after the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the qu@@ ad chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are going to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we just have players in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; condition is , however , that we even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford so many play@@ things . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled temporarily because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be some fres@@ her , because they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a rise in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are at present , &quot; says the Fort@@ una &apos;s inner def@@ enders . &quot;
although guests leave the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine matches . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you must hit from the outs@@ et , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s boss coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant .
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ old assessment tests published
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should examine the assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ rations C@@ ement ) was cri@@ tici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has sent out tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age .
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty consistent , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases stating that the subject was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det tried out the results of 5@@ 81 , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in the X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological age of men to see if they were earlier or later than by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the way of measuring should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot be sure , we should not do that as if we could , &quot; he said to the metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of being a child as an adult is negli@@ gible . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is , if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , manager at the road and traffic department of the head of government of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the work began at the same time on all three buildings need to be rehabil@@ itated between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule will be met .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a wooden arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurb@@ ished . &quot;
the other two bridges perform over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge .
this is a boundary fix@@ ation that is also used as an operating path .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge case is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian path will be lost .
&quot; the special thing about it is that it involves finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges .
special finger@@ tip attitude has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , where many companies are connected . &quot;
the local residents were informed in advance of the work by hand fl@@ yers about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and canc@@ ers initially had to be cut off . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the gathering point towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach Valley entrance , the road is closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben lin@@ den . &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three brid@@ ging can amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : coloured Prot@@ est with German Pot@@ ato salad
&quot; it &apos;s not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is hard to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ AG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land builds the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D fans , but demonstrate . &quot;
the theme &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; the City @-@ Pic@@ nic was originally planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful image that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel . he tried to make such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already established Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; well , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; in the Stadthalle there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Palat@@ inate Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the audi@@ torium there are about 200 people waiting to see that the top candidate for the German elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch hold their speeches . &quot;

tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wol@@ fold Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be found in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both sol@@ oi@@ sts are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and have staged solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new Gew@@ and , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , blend classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating piece of art . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was premi@@ ered only this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is involved consciously in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed che@@ eses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart spoke openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the apparently most famous relation of Hollywood stars was the story of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who eventually diver@@ ged bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brunette woman ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I have been . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed it . &quot;
so it never conf@@ uses me or hin@@ ders me .
I have never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them suffered , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , when she dressed like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially in the public , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to stay in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; some may call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today , I will say to you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump did a big announcement before the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than to make our country great .
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative corporations in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom , and is not able to find a positive one @-@ ending message , &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russian Athletics Director Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships , that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who were taken away from competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comment@@ aries , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed on the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has been recognized by itself , that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do anything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its rein@@ tro@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Athletics Championships , which will begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik is no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this was divided into the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen would agree with her husband &apos;s decision , so he said further in the message . &quot;
&quot; when Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to be king . &quot;
he retired in 2016 and also called the title &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the boss of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in London in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ rat , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years reign . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ ver@@ ing , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked up instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants spe@@ edy re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
it was on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous green member El@@ ke T@@ westen laid her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;

&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 68 seats in Lower Saxony &apos;s parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Diet will be elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Diet ends as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on Tuesday for further action .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament draws the confidence of the Prime Minister and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally certified , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally certified . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler named T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a practitioner of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens requested the dism@@ ember@@ ed members to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we naturally assume that she has received her country &apos;s mandate , which she received over the Green Territ@@ ory , with immediate effect , &quot; said the regional leaders Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &apos;s extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have chosen deliberately not to introduce a debate in the Group . &quot;
&quot; even against the background , that there were no differences in content , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the accession of the Dutch Green Euro MPs El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Euro MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .

&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses inf@@ ested eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder issue the latest information about the eggs @-@ char@@ gers involved . &quot;
the eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible . &quot;
Al@@ di now assumes the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
food monitoring is the task of federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and is in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health harmless .
&quot; if the residual current level of 0.00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the businesses are to blame .
are manufacturing enterprises and consumers on the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect economic damages due to suspected illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
as always there is too little control in serious cases .
is it missing only to the staff or the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent . &quot;
this is precisely why a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences may be present are of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment by the authorities .
is the regular al@@ arms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to buy only safe and transport@@ able foodstuffs .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly considered . &quot;
&quot; through the pan@@ eled tool manufacturers , dealers and consumers are caught in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the position of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it must be consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are spe@@ edi@@ ly and un@@ successfully elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how to impact football &apos;s financial rules on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can easily make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes down and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , considering the financing of the team by the rich hero family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must act against legitimate income sources that enable them to keep the break @-@ even point in their business related to football . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous deb@@ ts in their pursu@@ it of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the deb@@ ts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the crew and build a global brand - a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and despite Plat@@ ini 2015 dropped by the pres@@ idency in dis@@ grace , his opponent Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to frigh@@ ten himself from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million will be exp@@ elled for the next five years in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ hau@@ l their financial visibility by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ gic enterprise could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the PS@@ A sponsor@@ ship was m@@ owed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be and such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more vig@@ il@@ ant to take into account any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Arri@@ val is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regards to Qatar &apos;s latest owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you are different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new catalogue supplier
Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has been made for Swiss customers over the past few years .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the order an@@ ew .
&quot; on request of the news agency Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t , Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a report published by the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
about 17 million small red @-@ white packed ch@@ og@@ g@@ at panels about 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to passengers .
Swiss do not want to provide information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ der estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a bird producer it is a prestigious mission .
&quot; as many applicants are involved in the new tender , the Swiss will not want to disclose it . &quot;
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment . &quot;
chocolate tables distributed Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut , in collaboration with Hu@@ g , delivered the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ hau@@ l flights , the customers of the First Class are spo@@ iled with le@@ ak@@ age by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class ticket passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael show alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle @-@ aged play cool kids who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ ody goes more to the fo@@ undry principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ cks the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; a point off@@ s a character by an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ ing ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ SR@@ s ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart by &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it achieves what I expect as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang , how to see the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ West Ring campaign icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director speci@@ fies to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ headed Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dial@@ og@@ ues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
with six long epis@@ odes it moves up and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ acted to a lower length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always visiting the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who eng@@ ul@@ fed a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary public audience is that Western culture can do everything to for@@ age for a fortune .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and have already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; moreover , the officials ordered large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; during the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
at the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
more than 300 police officers were in action .
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , heavy acts of violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;

between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the great use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
ways acc@@ use large gaps in the alien register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the alien register in Germany bears significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly grave mistakes in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of For@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to partly serious mis@@ fortun@@ es in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; is present . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , ten million people with foreign nationality were recorded in the register , including approximately 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on paid people , moreover , EU citizens should not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such false assignments led &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with it , &quot; therefore it is said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugees families to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it says that BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant exp@@ anders to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) holds these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to this agreement as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening due to the lack in the Italian asylum system for human rights violations and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
&quot; in a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service has already been available to other people . &quot;
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his 100 donations , has now distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation appreci@@ ates multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood in the meeting of the Municipal Council . &quot;

&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed food is divided into its components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn producers reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K circular team leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 % of the donated blood donations . &quot;

Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulation on a rise .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they settled interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the monetary policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that pressure would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; however , it sign@@ alled that interest increases would be needed in the coming years to raise the inflation initiated by Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that credit expenses would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic package , issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February , although it is said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice since the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to reduce inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are forecast for this and next year , compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 USD and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro . &quot;
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have atten@@ u@@ ated the rising expectations of interest income and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth will likely fall at 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will easily recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and in@@ significant salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be prevented in the coming years , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year pro@@ g@@ nosis could be &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consumer spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in August following the shock@@ ing EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ eral . &quot;
&quot; the bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will reach the prices and the economy completely . &quot;
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed budgets , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the bank said this was expected and it will be tigh@@ tened in the coming months . &quot;
the bank said the excess in proportion to its goal of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ sow , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again since the len@@ ders are clam@@ our@@ ing for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ elled and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;

&quot; in September , patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ treatment pro@@ phyla@@ xis taken before intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service via a first three @-@ year study of approximately 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court , indicating that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess piece announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England MD Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to en@@ force human registration and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ treatment pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection endangered .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified participants who agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a primary doctor may also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by ass@@ essing clinical evidence , such as being used and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when targeted on need@@ y and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; said Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will quickly be carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and rel@@ uc@@ tance by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and termin@@ ate the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this study brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , declined in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t pack her bags and sold it .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room @-@ estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place for Jo@@ anne &apos;s life . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate storey in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to release the awar@@ ding .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to decor@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow him to work for longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable cu@@ is@@ ines are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room a luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which will help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t fall into the electric outlets in the walls .
these are important but they do not play with your heart .
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ rate of some standard into something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million dollar property imperial
&quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confron@@ tation with one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis res@@ ides in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bol@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dead father , Col@@ in - from Paul is described as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the corporate wealth and Paul about one third . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction states that this means that Col@@ in has ownership of CHF 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first mon@@ key v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed install@@ ments , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early mon@@ key v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event of hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ en@@ das from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says he started West@@ co , when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million for leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; bit@@ tered about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in beha@@ ved very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s claims . &quot;
&quot; our father had not wanted Paul and I would end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope appeared to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
b@@ umps of new chief of staff is planning to restrict the media &apos;s abst@@ in@@ ence from the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course . &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that got into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by super@@ vise his media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candi@@ ate Tr@@ ump was anger@@ ed because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing , &quot; &quot; said the former campaig@@ ner Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos; Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets without their intervention would contain even more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
&quot; if his colleagues managed to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him several times , then their efforts were worth it . &quot;
but no one has resol@@ utely managed to prevent Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump stuff that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advis@@ ors to bring the president for strategic reasons without any doubt .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out where these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February when someone canc@@ els a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Command@@ o K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source of a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false alle@@ g@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
dump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective as Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self and his consultants are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought crimin@@ als are received by mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the aid of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe will send post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after crimin@@ als are not known , they will be hoped and asked for information from the population . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting hidden on vacation destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed since 2016 . &quot;
&quot; 36 of online requests could be arrested so far , at least 11 of them on account of announ@@ cements after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the foot of war , who have negoti@@ ated a gr@@ ass@@ land drawn up by the community in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ging by the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence facilities and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
the Council must be forced through shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved on and returned . &quot;
&quot; more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; &quot; The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ place , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local who did not want to be called said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior with the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine , when we present our case . &quot;
Birken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s lord mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Mens@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been building a building container in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings were disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not wish to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sh@@ erer . &quot;
the performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ ing : us special promot@@ er sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Sonder@@ ler Robert Mu@@ eller , according to a report , is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper read the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied its investigations .
&quot; the sender CN@@ N reported , there are already the first rec@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps elec@@ toral campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand who acted as consultants of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more Tr@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the off@@ erer had personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
Grand Jury &apos;s main task is to review present evidence in possible crime cases and to determine whether charges shall be charged .
Grand Jury are therefore also called Ank@@ le Cham@@ bers .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to the hearing under E@@ id .
&quot; according to CN@@ N , inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ umps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed Kus@@ h@@ ner and his former head chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the obj@@ ections show that Mu@@ eller did not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury .
&quot; this work , however , usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey mentioned three times that not against the President .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ ussi@@ an accus@@ ation , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become no@@ isy , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de justice . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey was told in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the agent and his staff . &quot;
the solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
&quot; unlike an independent special event of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented law@@ suits on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dism@@ is@@ sed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant Eis@@ berg driving in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a giant ic@@ eberg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin was replaced by the Sch@@ el@@ fest . &quot;
this was divided by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the colli@@ sion over a tril@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres is now driving north and will probably take two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant in the last three decades . &quot;
it is not a danger to people .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the ic@@ eberg is un@@ clear according to research data .
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ down@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact@@ sheet . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus had so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest is located south of South America almost at the head of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; North of this archipelago , the balance of waxing and ab@@ ort was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete sni@@ per was broken down there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest is in danger , because the front edge has never moved back as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can collapse , if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
&quot; melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as it float on the water and pushed ice so much water as it produces after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the castle will cause the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could potentially increase the level of sea level , but only slightly , the British research project writes for observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest is the fourth @-@ largest shooting of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , according to AW@@ I data with nearly 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and we have no direct connection to climate change , the sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest withdrawal from the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest will continue to grow or fall back in the long term , and possibly collap@@ sing , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not bring back the demoli@@ tion of this giant ic@@ eberg to climate change , however , many c@@ ud@@ dly wol@@ ves of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have collap@@ sed over the past decades . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has gone back around 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;

CD@@ U wants a skin rate at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U , from the employers &apos; association , is demanding to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration took place in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administrative district in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there are 17 tra@@ inees their first working day .
the teaching points at the circle are apparently very popular .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; however , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the management should develop a concept for recru@@ iting staff and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should ori@@ ent both internally and extern@@ ally , pointing out specific measures for cross @-@ immig@@ rant and involve an apprentic@@ eship campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems which one previously did not know .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition by the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service in terms of disease or age . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that there are still more places to remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
he recently made a f@@ ist surprise in the working @-@ day for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel expenses and b@@ aff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; people want all options to be reviewed , which enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution in the short term , the district administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the members of the county - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; nations . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for public service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level that is geared towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution laws . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO @-@ migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet , &quot; because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with tra@@ ffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has been in operation for only one year , refused to express himself to the exhaus@@ tion of the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any alle@@ g@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat of &apos; youth retreat &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its occupation occup@@ ies infl@@ atable migrants , which will be delivered directly by tra@@ ffi@@ ckers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1,3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have on board an Italian police officer who super@@ vis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to ad@@ here to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy , decre@@ ed that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local civil masters have borne fruits . &quot;
&quot; during the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Palat@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three befri@@ ended guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome addition .
&quot; during hot summer temperatures , the first tour leads along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; view points followed , partly on towers from which one could look far above the Palat@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream pl@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long trials . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and the popular saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , look@@ out at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flying &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers arrived at the air @-@ air inhal@@ atorium cur@@ ative br@@ ine .
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had known the Palat@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps for E @-@ sports
&quot; in future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer con@@ soles , instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium racing ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales included . &quot;
this also recognized the first federal lig@@ aments which are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Managing Director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , that there are still quite some clubs on this move . &quot;
&quot; on the next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30 year olds , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA will be fo@@ ol@@ ed at competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ lies have long been established in which the pro@@ s compete against each other . &quot;
and e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme in the 2022 World Games .
but is it a kind of sport ?
for many people the idea is certain to get used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; there are also cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online gam@@ bling and in the scene the structures of classic sport lack@@ ed .
the scientist empha@@ sizes the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) is predic@@ ting rapid growth in the E @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales should be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ s of Uni@@ cr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport had been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football le@@ ague clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an E @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia , and the old times to be clari@@ fied , is no longer sufficient today . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time al@@ ig@@ ning the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; also means D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter is condemned to suicide because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation . &quot;
Carter was convic@@ ted in June due to the negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy that took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter was standing with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and facing down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have taken Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity to be there for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted by the cogni@@ tion &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person , with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring out of a building , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you need to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Carter needs attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared legal opinions .
&quot; the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder by her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain for the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ umps a big season to the F@@ ed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different in his room in the cabin , and Joshua struck me immediately even if the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philip Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself a tie to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ ed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bavaria Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the console could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ i could also interpret the sign of the coach .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen in the C @-@ El@@ f , existing from youth players , newcom@@ ers and especially from holiday professionals , but he . &quot;
&quot; however , sugar@@ s are most likely to be distributed to those you want to keep in a mood . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to compete with the heritage of Lah@@ m , can use a little extra motivation only well . &quot;
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashes over the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ eness .
&quot; on the right rear , this is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general , Kim@@ i worked like the one who can take the helm in his hand . &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
&quot; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot , did not drop neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; OK , now I just want BF@@ 1918 / 2 . &quot;
ISO @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyr@@ il@@ lic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) mac@@ intosh ( Mac@@ Roman )
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the game building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not what we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at the debut .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Rud@@ y did not give one or two , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to some cris@@ p statements on the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most known foot@@ b@@ aller lied about Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies wished all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is practically Klu@@ b@@ kol@@ lege of Ö@@ F@@ B captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fi@@ eb@@ ert with our Ladies .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational spr@@ int .
the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el could perhaps also take care of our ladies .
companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , which was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ els the old ministers .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the largest revers@@ al shift sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the connection of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the list of priorities of the country .
&quot; still this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 shall be the law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Traffic Sche@@ dule . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; of course , nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) of Trier , like from Wis@@ sing , asp@@ ires to a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate @-@ label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the I@@ HK is engaged . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
a premium of 1000 Euro is en@@ vis@@ aged for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates become self @-@ employed within ten years of master education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road construction , quick facts will be possible , at the same time lacking the country on the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Industry of the Chamber of Industry of Trier . &quot;
&quot; only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to employ Wis@@ sing during state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U Fra@@ ction vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf is referring to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less than proposed by country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept as to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; in addition , the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with grade 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ ing internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .

Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW CEO said that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; and moved on to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as call@@ ers .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen Oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens , and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases released by diesel vehicles , also accept what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful automotive companies and ignor@@ ing any signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could heavy burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; with the help of the Is@@ ar visitors , a raft goes through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
and that is not a bli@@ ss@@ ful raft with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building reference aims to elu@@ ci@@ date .
on the raft one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a gar@@ bage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public relations campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
the motto &quot; True Love is ... &quot; is intended to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protected wild river .
&quot; last summer , the raft went over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on illustr@@ ators , the no@@ uns of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
even with 85 the Argent@@ inians still draw and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proved himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation - what frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; big , rounded Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still working on the drawing , working every day for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks find his dro@@ spir@@ ing figures a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has also been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures .
the protag@@ onist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film that will come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s wei@@ rd for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he rather rel@@ ies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases transmitted insects , causing scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , big head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert at the agr@@ arian research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant in the past years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse says : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;

&quot; Krä@@ mer , Z@@ ün@@ emann , De@@ aler , Vag@@ ns or Land@@ sc@@ apes should be in the inner city these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the workers of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drugs wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the cabinet &apos;s cabinet or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and as the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is the publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts showing his smile face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ an@@ oia . &quot;
&quot; although a federal prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two pen@@ alties according to the committee for the protection of journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ odo@@ ca , they still ins@@ ist on treating Sin@@ alo@@ a &apos;s violence , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ent and although the territory is now even more tra@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the why , we are suspic@@ ious of all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he was only able to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla had been stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing as silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as ri@@ val@@ ing frac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ole@@ ums for Dru@@ gs that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; for a minute , forget that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug tra@@ its in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the blame , that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , pres@@ umed gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not comp@@ el Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper published in the same story . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the noise d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
repor@@ ters loved to publish harsh examinations without fear of cens@@ orship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle .
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ca , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ e team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine ruin ?
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assump@@ tions about how they can best do their job , and remain alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the publisher of Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters wonder@@ ed whether these officers are among the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who called the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the output of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spent three main stories . &quot;
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the government spending focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; and there was a group that was located in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly all the political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military assault . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; we had known earlier what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken .
Val@@ dez &quot; office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the employees have become something that they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by signing in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on side@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to sp@@ y and kill journalists , because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; by organised crime , by the government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces infected with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; during the last year , the media fan group &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; has more than half of the attacks on the journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were next to their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close the paper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of their Director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking is shock@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones started to bu@@ zz . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ alen and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 dead killed .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the ker@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on cell phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , who kept watch to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if it was killed on the same day at J@@ avier , the intern was asking me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible Rhin@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r cars in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well preserved condition has aston@@ ished scientists who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something which seemed to be out of place by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ pump . &quot;
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are only blin@@ king with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it is going into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as back@@ war@@ ping , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to blend into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family has made head@@ lines in May and is now shown at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ent@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ our about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ady is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds that of the animals living today . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ad@@ owing - think of roe , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ ric was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including its preserved intestinal system to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was so warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved cle@@ ft skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and preser@@ ves the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the guar@@ ded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops s@@ led by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pet@@ ri@@ fied her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ amped by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the door@@ step still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so &apos; rare as winning the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the beast .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
thunder@@ storm : mass @-@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , mile @-@ long st@@ out - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass @-@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police were around 5 pm between the connecting points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( administrative district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , inter@@ connected . &quot;
there is no information about the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten kilometres long way back was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it also occurred on the return track to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers that now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 6 : 45@@ pm , another accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue @-@ helicop@@ ter was on the road to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group checks &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing can be found on the train and sle@@ eps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and just has an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ p .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes us up or breaks the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et currently tests the free ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that you can take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two circuits . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the App of the Train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one gets into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
with the test@@ ers a button will appear for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the ticket inspec@@ tor appears at the ticket inspec@@ torate in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train crew , please check the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to shape their travel time in the train of personal information , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s Marketing Management Board . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who drives the train , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions are one of the biggest nu@@ is@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in control of your own ticket and takes over time to take care of other issues . &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; whose stream ?
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because nobody else posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly v@@ ested on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lively body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their fellowship .
she picked up her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman took his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... all of you will kill all of you . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have become acc@@ ust@@ omed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised therein .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience ec@@ static rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove to be a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camping area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were associated with a local business owner who had lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often by wh@@ ites - in a community which prof@@ ited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not cent@@ red their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist in the area known for his activ@@ ism around mort@@ al prisoners . &quot;
&quot; his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that in the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she fell in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like bare , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the person@@ alization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is genu@@ inely maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at Fer@@ rel@@ l because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sha@@ ved this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the foref@@ ront , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial links between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ashes to a song and she feels bound to this memory ever since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; during the one to the bit gallery , &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the rest of the shops are benef@@ iting , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall is standing , in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of construction work , it will be an end . &quot;
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Bed@@ a square with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying a weekly market in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ iden@@ s gladly again and again very gladly . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle depends on the amount of rent .
but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the offered product is fresh , is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops are hired only by bigger companies in a shopping centre , because the rent there is often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall go on during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes .
&quot; or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before , selling all shops out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the incredibly many - as I think - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more room . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ sections which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth where the former Secret Service Analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making public statements about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching resem@@ b@@ lance ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans @-@ wife and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 counts , including six viol@@ ins against the sp@@ ying law , fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which man is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde pig@@ gy - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette st@@ umps and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use have become un@@ equal bri@@ efs who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert the Over@@ seas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama , in fact , only a few days after the book was published , would require Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid circuits that it should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been asked for the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall there is a mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As are written in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by involving the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , can also be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerg@@ es from the disciplinary research of the United States as King Kong with a hands @-@ free phone .
&quot; if they place your speech , then they won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ac@@ res , which conver@@ ge like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor at the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
a nation@@ wide man@@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were searched as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury .
&quot; on Monday , War@@ ren ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
La@@ it has been an associate Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ junk@@ , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ it was now in a quar@@ terly assessment and excluded from entering the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities and North@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we were in contact with the police in Britain to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any conceivable manner .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he asked the susp@@ ects to challenge the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , rein@@ force themselves , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27 , too . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take a long time until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; at a certain stage to meet the criteria of the timet@@ able , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timet@@ able was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s timet@@ able to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of Rus@@ ada and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ually agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one pre@@ fers to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , Rus@@ ada was excluded from the conduct of dop@@ ing checks in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
but you were allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
&quot; after a visit to the main district of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Olivier Nig@@ gli said that Rus@@ ada moved &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di sells no eggs yet more
these were divided into groups of companies .
&quot; it was a pure precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; as of now , only eggs will be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative for fi@@ pron@@ il@@ containing anti @-@ lice . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clear and transparent to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness in your e @-@ commerce startup but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases enable whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in addition to s@@ nap @-@ p@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consent results so that you can re@@ bo@@ ast why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent can send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its employees are badly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters . &quot;
&quot; when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair intern@@ ships can be identified and addressed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used to hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and tas@@ sels companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , making total capital increased to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising because of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s . &quot;
staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors can reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees after your feedback , there may be a expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the shift is not fast enough or not at all , this dis@@ appointment can raise and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4.000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies too much rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who is now leading monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , so ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always gains new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better bonding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not bound to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the br@@ oth
it is about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have with@@ drawn their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the water man football center next morning .
&quot; this is true for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday came to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise , away from the two days , is more than a day at which the brother moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times performed in West@@ wood . &quot;
they are to hold 18 exercises over August . 20 before beginning of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they spread further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear guidelines of its fields from an ad@@ joining car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that already cleared a protective net behind a door@@ posts , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; in this weekend , Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can rent a room there and then adjust it to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ verification in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false error messages to third parties and show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible error messages and to send them to fact@@ checks that may display possibly results of the Fak@@ es check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters in the run @-@ up of the presidential elections in May were floo@@ ded with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to quickly er@@ adi@@ cate fi@@ du@@ ous post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of Fak@@ ten@@ u@@ pris@@ ers are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce incorrect messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a Castle in the History of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ as@@ ingly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emoti@@ onally . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter , written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters smell always smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also present . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , I have considered my welcome dig@@ its a little over@@ rated &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , explore the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archives , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats told &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , represent who had what had : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a wider base into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il who appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Cra@@ cken Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant rising began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good beginning . &quot;
maybe the two are connected together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rol that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed from the 18th century who filled his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , to keep deb@@ ts and spend money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying emp@@ tive old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique typ@@ ing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle vei@@ led in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the filling of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it is said to be a highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their yesterday un@@ subscri@@ bed website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that some things are better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action , it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they compete with other commun@@ es . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef presents its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on pension schemes and transports in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as previously , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the Deputy Prime Minister , the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consult@@ ations . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 9 ( Turkish ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 10 ( Latin 6 )
the government occup@@ ies the re@@ ins in the army .
&quot; the commander @-@ in @-@ chief Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the forces of air and the na@@ vy were dism@@ is@@ sed . &quot;
ISO @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyr@@ il@@ lic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) mac@@ intosh ( Mac@@ Roman )
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erd@@ og@@ an as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the put@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 people , who are supposed to have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt , Ankara has been negoti@@ ating in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the attempt of revolution as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an has really got the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the great pur@@ se of the army and the security forces continues at any rate .
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an sent other 73@@ 95 official servers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as though Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guards of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed the power of the military step by step , not least under appeal to the reform powers of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an promoted a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly not@@ orious officer called A@@ sy@@ l after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the commitment of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he pre@@ fers to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ orient@@ ated vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are given Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;
ministry to rehabil@@ itate route for Renn@@ stei@@ exhau@@ eren
&quot; again and again , over the past few months we have been argu@@ ing about the future of Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les - now it is to go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is planned to be built on the opposite side of the tourist railway line . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction works are scheduled to begin this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; said Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost for the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , will be finally agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian railway are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Rail@@ ways Society will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is one of the most popular railway connections between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to re @-@ order them in the future . &quot;
the route is also partly strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are at the moment a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key when publishing his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes even more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman progres@@ sively .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ti@@ ghtness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold robot developed by True Compani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms True Compani@@ on &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : dis@@ rup@@ tive ) Far@@ rah , troubled a most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; means it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
their formation and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to slightly dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore .
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R acknow@@ le@@ dges their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what se@@ eps out of the constraints can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time in which women &apos;s rights are threatened by women worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ g@@ matic to have women sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the intri@@ cate body and the pierc@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that might distur@@ b fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to put it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it became a tr@@ ump @-@ proof of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zed U.S. voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and thank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of dou@@ b@@ ting relatives .
we all re@@ strain ourselves to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited New York this week . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and cl@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his pussy meet us no longer . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself falling apart from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally fit to qualify themselves as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the carousel in the New York car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are hungry and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - most glo@@ omy and the cli@@ mati@@ sing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ e Pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; but Central Park @-@ Car@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to review my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which it is not necessary . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed gr@@ asp@@ ing while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar of Pist@@ ori@@ us ro@@ uted with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , which he suffered from the prison authorities in a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he held his girl@@ friend for a night@@ time intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to refu@@ te the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it was too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ator said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold found a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarter @-@ chang@@ ers from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; in future , three students will go to the secondary school , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , she welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of the school dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der selected a young eagle that grows in the chi@@ ckens , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band launched a musical called &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and cut it off from his chi@@ ckens .
&quot; instead of a chicken try , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken from him was crushed , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
&quot; h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders contributed to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Mrs Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished for every quarter that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by a letter of thanks to the colleagues , former head of school Michael Müller , who always starts with teaching len@@ ecks and the par@@ ental representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick time is now over , class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only leaves lessons very un@@ happy , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the neighbor@@ hoods . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students have heard a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in the process , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ blade holders have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 1 August , a group of people who had been illeg@@ ally camp@@ ed in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;
the inspec@@ tions will be continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suff@@ erers have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
need diesel drivers to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at diesel @-@ tops , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have provided software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the emission characteristics of cars in the emission category Euro 5 and partly euros 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa gives ass@@ essments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles , the Schumann Software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
its retro@@ fit has ordered the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation over the next few months , but no exact date . &quot;
Daimler has informed us to write to each affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be settled within the framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions go altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
it depends on manufacturers &apos; commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE reveals itself to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
now threat@@ ens a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE also fears that .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in the rural area , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE reveals to wait for sale yet .

&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ plan@@ ing park@@ platz , for example , have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will be@@ ech about 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in design , there is a large play@@ room for a city master . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dening , it can be flexibly responded to many . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ating city master emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything works here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years now , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
anyone who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should have a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with subject area architecture and have good knowledge of the fields of construction and construction planning law .
&quot; civil engineering and civil engineering , management of urban property , urban work with building yard and urban gar@@ dening as well as Lower building rights authorities including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines projected : South @-@ rail track blocked
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track tour in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them for the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a rose sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; that goes far beyond a bub@@ bling realm , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch as the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator or the perpetr@@ ator would have put themselves in great danger and also end@@ anger traction .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delays and the cost of replacement traffic , the rail@@ ways of the rail@@ ways could also be transferred to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the Süd@@ bahnhof could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were exp@@ elled in the morning , two of which were inter@@ cep@@ ting long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead pipes had to be replaced . &quot;
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study is the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ties , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while the suff@@ erers are normally advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ine are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna says : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an abundant nutrition is more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lieu condu@@ ci@@ ve if the same system is also present in humans . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe which was separately accommod@@ ated , this had not had . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al symptoms had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the dam@@ s of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om lack@@ ed and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the Cel@@ reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated by the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component is puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der made his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira pre@@ mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic , however , had been eliminated from the pro@@ visi@@ oning Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; apart from M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u took part in the Avi@@ va stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed three further commitments to Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US air@@ plane manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had previously made such advertising .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new set@@ back for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns however : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no bon@@ fires from the party central , but no opposition from the League - so was the most important wish of the elec@@ toral champi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been ob@@ serving the events in the state capitals of the SPD . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , is not even described in the approach . &quot;
there were sur@@ charges .
and one after the other .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U faces a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reli@@ eved , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber on the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has over@@ thrown the surprising fraction le@@ ak@@ age of a Green Party .
five months before the Sunday election its red @-@ green coalition thereby lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ President Michael Kell@@ ner asked the dism@@ is@@ sed Dutch Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and Leader of the Green Party on the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; an SPD election campaign si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reached the party centre on Friday mor@@ nings . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands up to the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the green dep@@ uty El@@ ke T@@ westen joins the CD@@ U . &quot;
it is the pro@@ visional high point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ ot@@ ted the comrades at his time . &quot;
&quot; according to the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
that was then even worse - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ m@@ eln , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te turned the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades in the weeks later re@@ bu@@ ked .
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next profound blow .
&quot; Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ mark , lost its Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in the crisis communication , he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ised for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese In@@ quiry @-@ values added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried increasingly to put acc@@ ents in the League of Acc@@ ents in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , also remained secret comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him because they promised to stabili@@ se the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party &apos;s internal compul@@ sion , in essence , no guilt . &quot;
and Schulz at all .
&quot; for the time being , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens and especially the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ westen .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ westen put her own career interests above the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD Bundestag faction , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected by her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Saxony MP further . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Bundestag faction , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters agreed four years ago : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U members fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local nucle@@ i III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , the mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives ST@@ EG presented urban development on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a look back on the events so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been given in sens@@ ational rehabilitation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is important to also promote internal development and not only open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I obtained the information from the Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , including 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality feeling . &quot;
what is the result of a refur@@ bish@@ ment area ?
&quot; one will continue investig@@ ating , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is interest to rehabil@@ itate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area limits could then be moved again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the content of the &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; program , in which the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living conditions and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding is ongoing until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; however , until September this year the survey would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area to fill a questionna@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the decision is to take place in order to start the renovation next year . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that each commun@@ e must carry out the predicted investigations . &quot;
it is about evalu@@ ating the urban gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when to repair and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um in the land register .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to feelings and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionna@@ ire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; where among other things it is about the construction state and the refur@@ bish@@ ment views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionna@@ ire , the &quot; Hous@@ ehold and Housing District , &quot; data on size , layout and inhabitants of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; business bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to note that God pointed out that a filled questionna@@ ire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphasized that the distribution of funds under the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot;
&quot; there is no need for funding for later &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a re@@ development &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ view , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ thesi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ lake also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the wh@@ aling posts of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers .
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicop@@ ter to the South Law@@ n for an event that out@@ lines American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers costs up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House &apos;s military office requested the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South Law@@ n , the unit responsible for operation of the helicop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the meeting of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty na@@ val agent for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at the South Law@@ n on the South Law@@ n at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and remained so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would need a second crew for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service . &quot;
&quot; the original plane cli@@ pping was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
the notes provided by TI@@ ME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal government to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the catch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; replied the dep@@ uty commander . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; on the event , the president granted an impulse for reform of the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ front government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump was conducting an investigation when the pres@@ et plane landed in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ain about the use of the pres@@ et plane by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the vice president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington area and South Law@@ n to reduce U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicop@@ ter units also flew 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential subsidies . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicop@@ ter on the South Law@@ n .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ing awards for the pres@@ et flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the hourly rate of the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of Un@@ ity record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to an R@@ AND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour on the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump was speaking to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really happy when he put his signature under the law on Wednesday evening to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hur@@ ry to leave the law , &quot; the Congress held a few &quot; constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the U.S. push . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft looks forward to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the Austrian OM@@ V , which together with other European companies have been co @-@ funded the construction of the Russian Eastern District of North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ en@@ li@@ sse is tremendous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even per Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the town organi@@ zes the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the clock will be turned back .
&quot; on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
&quot; no cooking is cooked , a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld district , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the past kit@@ esur@@ fing year , 28@@ 00 children each sat at the tables and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served 45 hours of week are served in the K@@ ita , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz explains . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time equi@@ val@@ ents have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat the delivered meals , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give away the food , wash away , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides over the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly affiliated with the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
so they are much more involved and it is easier for the students to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts .
because it is also about eating healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is very useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important to the children .
cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms hi@@ therto also the task of the kitchen ju@@ ices - will in future be done by special cleaning staff .
&quot; in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service , this variant - apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen service - also has the charm that it turned out for the city as the most economical way , it is from the press office . &quot;
and that even though 46 part @-@ time forces are adjusted .
&quot; but these hours do not fall into weight at around 750 people in education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an election for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against an election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will give the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ om said a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3.6 million voters registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union would like to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow work in Glasgow &apos;s managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory which produces other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ ying said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; expressing concern that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Turn@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrated strongly on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed for a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ ying said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to this because we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our customs cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations at the site change , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La Liga loves to regret his interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ umb to N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after giving out an offer of £ 189 million to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record crash ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has initiated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , where Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , even though a source close to the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign up one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter is kno@@ cked and damaged

Rezension : Ian Mc@@ E@@ wan : &quot; sweet To@@ oth &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report on the mis@@ use cases was reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen makes further discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the Reform Movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared after publication in front of the German press agency , he was waiting for the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the edited Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; , on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that the reporting on violence was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one dou@@ b@@ ted that it is &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; &quot; that would be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life , and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you &apos;re going to go on the church and that &apos;s a spot@@ ted fres@@ hing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; b@@ lows had been a very normal ped@@ ago@@ gical tool &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they find it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) , writes author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger to protect , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer Ulrich Weber ordered from the dioc@@ ese Regensburg to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; to summari@@ ze , this means that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
especially with high emoti@@ on@@ ality the punishment for the pupils could also be more violent .
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even bind positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence on Protection In@@ soles at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ an and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a cath@@ ode was musi@@ cally not a top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger actually occurs in it . &quot;
he is devoted exactly once to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , it is possible to blame him at best , to experience it too late or have not taken the first remarks seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gram@@ mar school , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains of its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; that he not only cra@@ cked with chairs and threw the key onto the ground , but also for@@ given ear tips and too nau@@ ghty boys on the hair or ears , he has already given years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widely used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I too have experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely , the horri@@ fying sexual abuse and the exc@@ uses of violence at the pre @-@ school , they are certainly tri@@ b@@ als . &quot;
&quot; one wonders , whether it is not with his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
many people who never understood him are still working eag@@ erly at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report bur@@ dens Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , a lot about abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported in connection with the report . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or co @-@ involvement in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were inaugur@@ ated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said a person concerned for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they do not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , it is certainly not a ch@@ oral director who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ er student formulated it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had timely insights and could have stayed the respective cul@@ pri@@ t .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that it is obvious to him ... Bu@@ es have opened more intru@@ sive or more clearly or even more than compared with their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that one speaks about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that the student and / or their environment affected him , could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any sympathy . &quot;
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the advertisement . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these conf@@ lic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was much to read about &quot; &quot; forci@@ ble esses &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former director Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is again an abuse of the report .
&quot; it is clean divided : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say , other alle@@ g@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the report also deals with inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which a child of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers have been har@@ k@@ ani@@ zed and pic@@ tured and suffered , all occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states must have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with those of whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the cathedral school gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as most of the witnesses stress , the topic &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in this way , at most is the repro@@ ach to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently eng@@ ul@@ fed the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral school gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out to him , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school he will continue to practice the punishment . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press release , he felt urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , she acted in a legal gray area , as each one of us knows yet . &quot;
it was difficult for him to estimate where the persons concerned might exagger@@ ate or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been crossed .
but one cannot say that he would always have looked away .
this is simply not right .
only in 1980 the death penalty was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis stated that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; fall@@ out of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of estim@@ ating the past according to current moral standards . &quot;
the princess already was right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what was ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in shelter , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ nest@@ ness and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image from his Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of testing penalty also available ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y alone , one does not make a big singer from the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience George R@@ atz@@ inger in conversation with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , gra@@ cious , deeply faithful and heart@@ felt people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could even do just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ ans still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ fication , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him up to this day , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the Dom@@ sp@@ ans are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to whom she still looks and which she almost ven@@ er@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; and please , again quite clearly : everything that you submit to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; the evil intent that stands behind it , is all too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the stand would like to give a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has earned great earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
