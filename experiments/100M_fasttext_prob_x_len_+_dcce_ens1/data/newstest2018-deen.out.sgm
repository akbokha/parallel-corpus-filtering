<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the one-time basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but very informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickenteppich that one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"more detailed maps, so-called" "Urination Sheets", "were incorporated into the large picture postcard."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were based on data from the Bavarian distribution administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalil War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the Neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward and founded the "topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Palace Department.</seg>
<seg id="19">The statement sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is sub-sendling that appears relatively isolated in the 1856 card.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was included 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, in the district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, sub-sendling lies in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming a smaller one appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered pipes from the so-called" "primordial" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the" "Land in Sonne". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Lower-sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" at Gasteig "or from the hill" On the Ventilation "- but also in big letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">ISO-ir-111 (Cyrillic KOI-8) macintosh (MacRoman)</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the establishment - that psychiatrist, which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up buying the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he forbids the staff to use force against inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"there was room for 280 patients, later extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the gyrorenum in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, is located there."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, youths meet at the Salesianum Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order warmed the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West, the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the Children's House" Casa Don Bosco "was built in an architectural style based on the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing attacks."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was marked by 1856 as" "Main Place", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies had a lot of holes in the inner city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days took place and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony took place for the second suburban rail."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the State, as a series of questionable, racial-based incidents occur lately throughout the state and be noted here," "says the Group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, which disproportionately on minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are arrested or killed because of their skin colour," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline any more during the journey and was taken custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General State Prosecutor of Missouri, where it is shown that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's view to further race profile."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU member Peter White and Kordula Kovac have acquired a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU association were met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Schwarzwaldmilch "is for him the alternative commercialization path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">The table of the Feriengäste is exclusively Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland care for a lot of work, much must be handled with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not lead bio-operations."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy about the promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">One hopes that the forestation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and worry about how they will continue their operation," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the exposure area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the shipments were promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers had to spend 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter White also stated:" "the best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-to-state support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the holding of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of a conveyance indicated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the enclosed area must not be traceable (slope inclination of 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherman's electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the exposure area corresponds to 35 hectares, calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">The White House of Trump is now accepting the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic asylum in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not grasp the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and liberty-imitators would have laughed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it appealed to its significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta insisted," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem to which you refer to which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correctly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the raging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your rubbish, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long for free to breathe free, the elding trash of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elend garbage" on our screens was better seen.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to switch it back from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one, but rather an early neoconservatives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is going on. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not lighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh has come across something quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not supposed to lighten the path, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Schotten were part of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"Director of Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member contingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "something special develops in Scotland" and the athletics of the UK has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry it on until we find out," Black said. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidate, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh did quite naturally were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in its fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that have been reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"the middle-distance runner Muir leads along this road, and last year has set five British and two European records."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" "hugely proud" "on the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this kind of home support and benefit from the fact that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers smote him for anything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked in the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said," "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to the slaughter." ""</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hoose employees have blocked and deleted the contributions from at least 450 people, expressing their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defended it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the Governor dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of people who come to the governors page - which is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post Hoose Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spamming people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just true people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was uncrowded, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I kindly agreed that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," "she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same topic, then they are more likely to be regarded as a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor of the Governor referred to as" concentrated spam attack "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest and arrest demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"ISO-2022-jp (Japanese, email) euc-kr (Korean) gb2312 (Chinese, simplified) gb18030 (Chinese, simplified)"</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County completes the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable porn had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers spread between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck at his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them into silence.</seg>

<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year," said Home leader Heiko Becher. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he moved his own study on this subject from 1994."</seg>

<seg id="239">"the construction works in the Villinger Strasse are in full swing and" "reasonably in time," "said the director of the courtyard Fred Heinze."</seg>
<seg id="240">"in the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since the underground is much bent, which is not marked in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">"the traffic, which is constantly hampered by construction work, represents a major problem for the construction of the company Stumpp."</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of motorists from red lights and butterflies is already enormous," Heinze reports. "</seg>
<seg id="243">The road is closed and only the buses are eligible for passage.</seg>

<seg id="249">It even rarely uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">"in her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regentship in the unquiet Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called" nota "- directly in the chimney."</seg>
<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the cropped dumplings with zealous, unwashed hands are removed and swallowed."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the loft floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example wash clothes with water from the nearby swamp."</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course, too late to work can be dangerous: most of the village men are unemployed, and many drink heavy and there are soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to walk around in the village after 5 o'clock," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in advance of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up for independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Jakarta Government, which maintains control over the region and foreign journalists or observers exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea into the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the car.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transportation.</seg>
<seg id="263">"the city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and from corrugated shelves that were converted into different yellowish tones by rust."</seg>

<seg id="276">Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">"according to activists, more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military."</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas tribal highlands in the 1970-s were committed to genocide according to the Asia-Human Rights Committee.</seg>

<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents occur," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="282">The screws have increased since Papua's resources bring a influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants come from the most populous islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."</seg>

<seg id="287">It has the native Papua - the mom mom [the women] from Papua - cost her market.</seg>
<seg id="288">"the Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his election campaign in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="289">"the former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta."</seg>

<seg id="292">"in fact, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowis initiation in October."</seg>
<seg id="293">"on December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out there and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers dragged on a motorcycle through the darkness."</seg>

<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="325">"instead, everything is regulated by law," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="326">"it was alleged that 11 cases of violations of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident."</seg>

<seg id="335">"after buried the corpses, the military searched for me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="336">The shootings have not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">"during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children."</seg>
<seg id="339">"the man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douf, drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital."</seg>

<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the territory.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and damal who live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>

<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never dive again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: mostly nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota only cost 10,000 Indonesian Rupiah (75 Cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitive.</seg>

<seg id="364">Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions of reporting international media remain tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalist Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although rare permission was given to them."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelin Kine, the representative Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's unquiet eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa-refusal and a black list," "he said in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="369">A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific countries demanded - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua, including the Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically been supporting the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"as an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited her silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua would probably not vote for Jokowi again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," said Gobai, Chairman of the tribal Council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants to know that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider her voice for Jokowi as a" "guilt" "he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai shot-victims performed a last symbolic act of the defiance: the corpses of a victim were buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that they will never give justice to them, but at least they do not forget their crimes."</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family was killed," said Yacobus with a lowered head. "</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 at a serenade."</seg>

<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and supporters of Tumline to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village Kleinod."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in a document in the Württembergischer Urcustomer-book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogster" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a marvellous court, belonging to which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="473">So people lived there too.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as seen from the description of the Freudenstadt district of 1858, next to the village and the Oberdorf that is still visible in the village of Tumbled, the" mountain "of the third, the manorial settler of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient maps from the period around 1600 confirm this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church, and was able to bequeath his church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"thus, the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two mercies on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were plagued and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops placed near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"by 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's night in 1834 a storm broke the tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the Turmzwerg still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim persists" "sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the country council."</seg>
<seg id="506">"the" "Boisheim" "association is called upon by Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back its permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal, a wind-power-concentration camp existed."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "parasification" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette for a few days before, but it had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf because of a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval is still unlawful and therefore also to decline." "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break the city council has again decided the concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette, a approval from the district government is still pending."</seg>

<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four per 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company in which the city of Viersen had been involved in cash, has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered, which corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-person households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"in the past summer, Viersen Stadtrat gave a green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="868">"I don't know how we are going to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we just have players in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>

<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, whereas in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was" possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he said to the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">"the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age."</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases stating that the subject was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet tried out the results of 581, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, in the X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars World record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the guiding organisation that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can easily make the money loose, so that Neymar writes down and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, considering the financing of the team by the rich hero family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must act against legitimate income sources that enable them to keep the break-even point in their business related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after his election to the UEFA president in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the crew and build a global brand - a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and despite Platini 2015 dropped by the presidency in disgrace, his opponent Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten himself from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting on the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sum of EUR 44.4 million will be expelled for the next five years in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overhaul their financial visibility by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a catargic enterprise could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was mowed by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 argued that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant to take into account any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1150">"PSG expects that Neymars Arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales."</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">"the Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt FFP."</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regards to Qatar's latest owner of PSG. "</seg>

<seg id="1263">Bank of England will probably be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened the speculation on a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when they settled interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the monetary policy makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflationary report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure would continue to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>

<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecasting of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice since the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required to reduce inflation and a" slightly greater "extent than the markets expect."</seg>

<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have attenuated the rising expectations of interest income and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth will likely fall at 0.3% in the third quarter, even though it will easily recover after the end of the year."</seg>

<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot be prevented in the coming years," but she added that wages at the end of their three-year prognosis could be "recuperate." "</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which is compensated for a part of lower consumer spending."</seg>

<seg id="1284">"the bank estimates that it will likely take four years, until this will reach the prices and the economy completely."</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed budgets, with three political decision-makers in July demanding a rise to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said this was expected and it will be tightened in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1296">Pretreatment prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection endangered.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>

<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by assessing clinical evidence, such as being used and implemented on a large scale."</seg>

<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>

<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctance by the government. "</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and terminate the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This study brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sold it.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room-estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place for Joanne's life."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate storey in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively in order to release the awarding.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelworks are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to decorate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work for longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable cuisines are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that when you push the door very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room a luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which will help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't fall into the electric outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important but they do not play with your heart.</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square meterrate of some standard into something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this."</seg>

<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Boller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>

<seg id="1364">A place of jurisdiction states that this means that Colin has ownership of CHF 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first monkey vit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed installments, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early monkey vit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the event of hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessendas from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>

<seg id="1382">"only Colin answered by SMS, to say" I can really not say much, "because the case is before the courts."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions, if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by supervise his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candiate Trump was angered because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing," "said the former campaigner Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps' Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets without their intervention would contain even more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his colleagues managed to keep annoyance from him several times, then their efforts were worth it."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has resolutely managed to prevent Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump stuff that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advisors to bring the president for strategic reasons without any doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he can find out where these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February when someone cancels a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Commando Katie Walsh to be" the source of a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false allegations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Dump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective as Priebus but Trump is still his impulsive self and his consultants are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1429">"travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull, called the" Millionärs series. ""</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May without being deterred by a ditch digging by the Council to prevent their incidents."</seg>

<seg id="1432">"angry inhabitants have urged the Council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous residents said:" "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by."</seg>

<seg id="1445">The former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's lord mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Mensalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building a building container in front of the entrance, and when one enters the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings were dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer is expressing."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>

<seg id="1468">"one does not wish to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a higher downtown level, Scherer stresses."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel at home in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, so sherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line." ""</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affing: us special promoter sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, Sonderler Robert Mueller, according to a report, is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper read the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the sender CNN reported, there are already the first recitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps electoral campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand who acted as consultants of the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the offerer had personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the President might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">Grand Jury's main task is to review present evidence in possible crime cases and to determine whether charges shall be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury are therefore also called Ankle Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversy cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to the hearing under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"apart from Trump Jr., also Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former head chef Paul Manafort were at the meeting."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening, legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the objections show that Mueller did not intimidate himself in his work and that he should act quickly if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the charge of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject gives the democrats a way to" "feel good" "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work, however, usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey mentioned three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this russian accusation, accusations against Trump have become noisy, he wanted to impede justice."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey was told in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to the representation of US media, the White House gathered material against the agent and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The solved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special event of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented lawsuits on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant Eisberg driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin was replaced by the Schelfest."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was divided by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the collision over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres is now driving north and will probably take two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant in the last three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">It is not a danger to people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factsheet."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus had so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfest.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfest is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this archipelago, the balance of waxing and abort was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete sniper was broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"it is a lot to say that even the Larsen-C-Schelfest is in danger, because the front edge has never moved back as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can collapse, if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as it float on the water and pushed ice so much water as it produces after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the castle will cause the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could potentially increase the level of sea level, but only slightly, the British research project writes for observation of the Antarctic (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Larsen-C-Schelfest is the fourth-largest shooting of the Antarctic, according to AWI data with nearly 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and we have no direct connection to climate change, the sign is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest withdrawal from the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C-Schelfest will continue to grow or fall back in the long term, and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not bring back the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, however, many cuddly wolves of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed over the past decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has gone back around 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>

<seg id="1558">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the request of the parties, the management should develop a concept for recruiting staff and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to cover not only short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortages."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orient both internally and externally, pointing out specific measures for cross-immigrant and involve an apprenticeship campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems which one previously did not know.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a real "competition by the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service in terms of disease or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"so, the highest time for action so that there are still more places to remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>

<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation" Youth Rettet, "because their team effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the aid organisation, which has been in operation for only one year, refused to express himself to the exhaustion of the Italian prosecutor's Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any allegations that are currently raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'youth retreat', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>

<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place only 1,3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have on board an Italian police officer who supervises their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" essential changes or disabilities "to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy, decreed that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local civil masters have borne fruits."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"during the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine female bikers, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and sights."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three befriended guides available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burg- and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">"during hot summer temperatures, the first tour leads along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim."</seg>
<seg id="1603">"view points followed, partly on towers from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and the popular sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, lookout at the lookout point, connected by" flying "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers arrived at the air-air inhalatorium curative brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had known the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips for E-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium racing?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long been a serious business to become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This also recognized the first federal ligaments which are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-sports department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the VfB," says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is certain, that there are still quite some clubs on this move."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"on the next weekend, FIFA World Cup in London organized the first" Interactive Club World Cup "in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt sees great potential in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30 year olds, that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"at E-Sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends "," Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or just the football simulation FIFA will be fooled at competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Lilies have long been established in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">And e-sport is already part of the official programme in the 2022 World Games.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many people the idea is certain to get used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"there are also cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte player is a good player." ""</seg>
<seg id="1637">"robber also sees problems:" "doping becomes more and more a topic." ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult for online gambling and in the scene the structures of classic sport lacked.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the highly integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the road internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) is predicting rapid growth in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales should be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport" is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "write the Deloitte consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Large markets are Asia and the USA where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood-actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-bets of Unicrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">A lot of things are happening in Europe too.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, E-Sport had been introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobber."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football league clubs according to Dutt are now obliged to set up an E-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia, and the old times to be clarified, is no longer sufficient today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," also means Dutt. "</seg>
<seg id="1656">"you can't stick to it, that only in football everything remains as it was always."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend by texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted in June due to the negligent killing of Conrad Roy that took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter was standing with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and facing downward eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have taken Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters Attorney said it was a" "terrible circumstance that they totally regret." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find that her" age or maturity "or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that" there is no day in which I don't have the loss of my beloved Son. "</seg>

<seg id="1679">"no longer this only person, with whom I have been together since my birth every day, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring out of a building, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>

<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter needs attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the case.</seg>

<seg id="1727">This shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time tadels the old ministers.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer (VTU), says," "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy, which has all blocked Lemke."</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described companies as callers.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert at the agrarian research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant in the past years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn.

<seg id="1800">"there is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cades, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>

<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the cabinet's cabinet or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and as the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is the publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smile face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two penalties according to the committee for the protection of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoca, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolent and although the territory is now even more traitors."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the why, we are suspicious of all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he was only able to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla had been stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject Valdez, there is practically nothing as silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rivaling fractions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey Mausoleums for Drugs that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"for a minute, forget that there is a state of" peace "when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traits in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame, that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all there was the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, presumed gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not compel Valdez to leave the country for its own security, following the confiscation of another newspaper published in the same story."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the noise dowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish harsh examinations without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoca, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for her reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you're playing the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoe team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse as a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job, and remain alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 per cent of the policemen who called the governor himself as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the output of this week, Riodoce has spent three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending focused on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that was located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly all the political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were charged with high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped from a military assault."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we had known earlier what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez "office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something that they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by signing in organised protests" SOS Press "on sideways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuses the authorities to spy and kill journalists, because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "surrounded" "by organised crime, by the government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces infected with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"during the last year, the media fan group" "Articulo 19" "has more than half of the attacks on the journalists of the police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas Kartell," Here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the paper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do El Manana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is shocked."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to buzz."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with Bandenrivalen and security forces near the Mazatlan beach had left 19 dead killed.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as promised by a series of Kartell embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the kerb edge, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on cell phone."</seg>

<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen, who kept watch to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces."</seg>

<seg id="1924">"now, researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible Rhinos of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the best preserved dinosaur, ever found, and one of the best dinosaur cars in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurs who lived in the middle of the chalk age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preserved condition has astonished scientists who describe it as" "truly remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something which seemed to be out of place by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 Pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth-pump."</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are only blinking with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as backwarping, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to blend into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurs family has made headlines in May and is now shown at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markentchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armour about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shady, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shady is customary, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that the evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the shadowing - think of roe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this Nodosauric was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life, including its preserved intestinal system to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was so warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved cleft skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge therods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the guarded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops sled by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the petrified herbivores were swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the doorstep still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so 'rare as winning the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the beast.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised therein.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience ecstatic racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove to be a bad service to keep it away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camping area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter were associated with a local business owner who had lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often by whites - in a community which profited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centred their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the area known for his activism around mortal prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years following Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that in the movement" not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "Folayan said, it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferris's life as she fell in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like bare," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the personalization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is genuinely maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "at Ferrell because of their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shaved this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these junctions as a black gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clashes to a song and she feels bound to this memory ever since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"during the one to the bit gallery," This would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" This would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a man "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the rest of the shops are benefiting, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall is standing, in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of construction work, it will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Beda square with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying a weekly market in the farmer's market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the maidens gladly again and again very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will settle depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this should not be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the offered product is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops are hired only by bigger companies in a shopping centre, because the rent there is often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a Markthalle does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall go on during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it create the ghost bit gallery before, selling all shops out of Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the incredibly many - as I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more room."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarsections which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth where the former Secret Service Analyst served a 35-year sentence after making public statements about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching resemblance)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-wife and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created the algorithmic analysis of DNA, extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data could look like, and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 counts, including six violins against the spying law, fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-white selfie, in which man is visibly sitting on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde piggy - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a magazine magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse have become unequal briefs who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" Suppressed Images, "which foresaw a future in which the President would convert the Overseas judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama, in fact, only a few days after the book was published, would require Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid circuits that it should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg has been asked for the weird timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a particular reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the" automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall there is a mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As are written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by involving the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the disciplinary research of the United States as King Kong with a hands-free phone.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they place your speech, then they won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacres, which converge like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg by portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were searched as suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Warren (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Court."</seg>

<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials got a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the scene, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lait has been an associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubjunk, the Vice President for University Relations, said in an e-mail explanation that Lait was now in a quarterly assessment and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities and Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we were in contact with the police in Britain to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any conceivable manner.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he asked the suspects to challenge the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them, reinforce themselves," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"said Guglielmi, the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27, too."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victims had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>

<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage to meet the criteria of the timetable, Rusada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA timetable was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's timetable to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re-establishment of Rusada and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has got a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"mutually agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" "we repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one prefers to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, Rusada was excluded from the conduct of doping checks in Russia in November 2015."</seg>

<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it enables companies to conduct surveys, to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases enable whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" "said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement."</seg>
<seg id="2212">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to snap-polls and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consent results so that you can reboast why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to stay, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post, which describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start-ups like GLINT, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"as GLINT, Convercent can send tailored" pulse "surveys to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that its employees are badly treated or behaved unethical, it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, since the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships can be identified and addressed more quickly."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">"companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used to hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and tassels companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, making total capital increased to $47 million."</seg>

<seg id="2240">"in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets."</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors can reach Rendites when their portfolio companies run well. companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">"if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support."</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have withdrawn their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and she actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise, away from the two days, is more than a day at which the brother moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times performed in Westwood."</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are to hold 18 exercises over August. 20 before beginning of formal preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous burden on her three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said. "</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they simply pushed it through, they spread further, they are great people."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"the UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which in view of the clear guidelines of its fields from an adjoining car park and the adjoining Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class that already cleared a protective net behind a doorposts, will not be an easy task."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when publishing his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepper woman progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shytightness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy gold robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed to conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: disruptive) Farrah, troubled a most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" means it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing sophistication point to slightly darker and deeper in our culture to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR acknowledges their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the constraints can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time in which women's rights are threatened by women worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has been pragmatic to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maidservant ') are not the graphic pictures, the intricate body and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study is the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulties, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the sufferers are normally advised to steer meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promotes immune cells in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna says:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan abundant nutrition is more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieu conducive if the same system is also present in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe which was separately accommodated, this had not had."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial symptoms had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the dams of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiom lacked and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the Celreuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated by the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component is purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House's military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the meeting of his superiors, the deputy naval agent for aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on the South Lawn at 3 o'clock in the morning, and remained so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would need a second crew for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original plane clipping was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The notes provided by TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the catch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," replied the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the" "Made in America" "event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"on the event, the president granted an impulse for reform of the reform of health reform, which was in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to confront government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>

<seg id="2738">"as Trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 introduced 58 practice landings at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted on the training requirements of the flight crew for the month, said an official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units also flew 11 hours a day for "non-presidential subsidies."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budgeting awards for the preset flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the hourly rate of the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of Unity record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to an RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but consider the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>

<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano ", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the reporting on violence was measured with" double standards. ""</seg>

<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life, and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>

<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a cholerian and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a cathode was musically not a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is devoted exactly once to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of complicity or co-knowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violent excesses at the pre-school also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to blame him at best, to experience it too late or have not taken the first remarks seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the grammar school, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger explains a very excellent testimony, describes him as" warm hearted, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "" "competent" "and" "comprehensible", "" "competent" "and" "comprehensible", "" "competent" "and" "comprehensible", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent" "and" "comprehensible", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent" "and" "comprehensible", "" "competent" "and" "comprehensible", "" "competent", "" "competent" "and" "comprehensible", "" "competent" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains of its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he not only cracked with chairs and threw the key onto the ground, but also forgiven ear tips and too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he has already given years ago, deeply regretted and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it must be said, however, that such educational methods were widely used in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I too have experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely, the horrifying sexual abuse and the excuses of violence at the pre-school, they are certainly tribals."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders, whether it is not with his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who never understood him are still working eagerly at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report burdens Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, a lot about abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen has been reported in connection with the report."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or co-involvement in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted himself to the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "said a person concerned for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, it is certainly not a choral director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioner student formulated it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had timely insights and could have stayed the respective culprit.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that it is obvious to him... Bues have opened more intrusive or more clearly or even more than compared with their parents, dormitory managers, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" that the student and / or their environment affected him, could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any sympathy."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was much to read about" "forcible esses" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former director Georg Ratzinger was accused of" "looking out" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is clean divided: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which a child of sadistic teachers have been harkanized and pictured and suffered, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states must have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those of whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the cathedral school gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as most of the witnesses stress, the topic" "pre-school" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and in many cases even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in this way, at most is the reproach to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently engulfed the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral school gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out to him," that in the pre-school he will continue to practice the punishment. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press release, he felt urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing punishments were banned in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, she acted in a legal gray area, as each one of us knows yet."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the persons concerned might exaggerate or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he would always have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the death penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the" fallout of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of estimating the past according to current moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess already was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not for what was abrogated in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in shelter, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so earnestness and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image from his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger played in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing penalty also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, one does not make a big singer from the rebellious boys and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience George Ratzinger in conversation with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, gracious, deeply faithful and heartfelt people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could even do just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with how many former Domspans still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his emerification, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him up to this day, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the Domspans are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to whom she still looks and which she almost venerates."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again quite clearly: everything that you submit to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intent that stands behind it, is all too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand would like to give a 93-year-old man who has earned great earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
