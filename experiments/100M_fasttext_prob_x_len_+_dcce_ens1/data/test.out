28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; the brother of the victim told him that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; finally it went up with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the Department of Fine Arts in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were shock@@ ed and destroyed on the ground .
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia posted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; connecting his family with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of conflict .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .

J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or stuck from outside labels , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather dum@@ b me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
&quot; as a favorite , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the TV with a loose rub@@ ble and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for white blood , she asks the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a little variation with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they ch@@ ased in fast gal@@ lop at home to the feed arches . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he settled with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even s@@ have for photography . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports team handed over to the man from An@@ hausen on a small g@@ ala the Gold Sports Pyr@@ amid .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the Sports Pyr@@ amid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of EUR 25,000 . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday . &quot;

many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illu@@ stri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on where the Lav@@ azza award was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not aware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and war@@ ns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely rep@@ ay regulations , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the issue of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in that need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost immediately say . &quot;
the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical party wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump you could get party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ operate coal mining in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spir@@ ing trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both Americans do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , for example , Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a che@@ at .
he wants to increase her to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be up , then he says he &apos;s not going to be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the taxation policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics point to him so that the budget defic@@ it would only be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton who wants to demand at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every fu@@ cked woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house provides shelter .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looked curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tabl@@ etop .
until it real@@ ises that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene looks normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ run women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men there - not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope @-@ bear@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are other reasons for women to flee : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , volunte@@ er@@ ism , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run this continues .
&quot; that tu@@ gs , for example , demand a sexual act for a bottle of water , is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so acc@@ ust@@ omed to saying that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experienced , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help themselves , more accommodations are needed only for them . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is such a thing in accommodations of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or own houses for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women stay together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much women feel this protective need , can be read at the rush , which there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
assistant physicians : demands for new work combat measures
Deputy of the Assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new work combat measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat measures starting in early September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
assistant physicians and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which resulted in the agreement to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official re @-@ accession to all your wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Bureau today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work combat measures starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assist@@ ants of this year strike six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
head of the BM@@ A Assistant Doctor Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health said Jerem@@ y H@@ unt , that the contract for physicians in England would be forced into force . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg palace , I can &apos;t for@@ bid the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed st@@ alli@@ ed , and he spar@@ ed very little heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin stated and accused Ankara to have Russia fallen into his back .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build the ve@@ to will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media held a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks were to blame for everything .
&quot; seriously , the alle@@ g@@ ations of senior officials that Erd@@ og@@ an had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been dism@@ is@@ sed almost his ministry last month with a failed state coup .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed . &quot;
they count on a late a@@ ison@@ al rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , State television pre@@ di@@ cts cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ ej@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted coup of power as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - he pi@@ cks out to benefit from the cool m@@ oods and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that even a deep @-@ seated fear of the regime change .
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries who are driven away from the West and feel badly treated , and now f@@ ade away . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides . &quot;
&quot; it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they had@@ n &apos;t even stro@@ ve the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately chose to answer a question of their differences , while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey sh@@ ou@@ ted the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once more . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the board of directors , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan granted the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer stamps . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sports with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange listing lead to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for retail , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he distributed the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we now become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers in these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer be continued and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;

I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;

&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in obstacle races - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record breaking career . &quot;
firm of the Year for Pat@@ ents d@@ f @-@ mp Dör@@ ries Frank @-@ Mol@@ nia &amp; P@@ ohl@@ mann
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ys of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only few have achieved before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already sli@@ pped in the UK for nearly 30 years what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British scene for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doubts and to return to his fun@@ eral . &quot;
and he is not yet in the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin Con@@ fir@@ med Forces Chief Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ is@@ sed his chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s strict confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters .
in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin it reads that Putin ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without giving reasons .
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Deputy Chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo emb@@ assy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was Log Chief and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state as regards bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president at once wanted to direct Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ aining for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; when Putin arrived in power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , Putin &apos;s closest ally , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings to the &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers , &quot; which are approaching completion at each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics Keith Brown entered the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the sealing shows tr@@ end@@ setting high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street deck and its connection with the northern tower remaining in the expansion , we had to close the gap left on the north or the shore . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 feet long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
three men still have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boats to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re r@@ n@@ li rescue station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fis@@ her boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ oy w / she without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have luck un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; although the boot engine had an emergency stop , this triggered the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
seriously injured - Man suff@@ ers for his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
&quot; as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ based perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when he came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
she then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her companions . &quot;
on the road they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who is building Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken much more seriously in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 beneficial apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; action concept living &quot; at the next council meeting .
but contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban surfaces must in future exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big right of strike in the town hall is , however , &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors looking for private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions of dollars and needs to be financed , should provide incen@@ tives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ man : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants to satisfy even harder requirements for investors .
&quot; not@@ with@@ standing this , as a viol@@ inist , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market is reflected . &quot;
&quot; if the concept is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the programme is not entirely new : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of some 1300 favourable apartments , whose funding will be implemented over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planners &quot; planners Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ going bonds of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western town the dead@@ lines run at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western town is increased dramatically , one removes from the aim of the so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be no movement in the discussion .

I concentrate on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; teen@@ agers and children don &apos;t go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens , was lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and get more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters first created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later resulting from a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was shi@@ fted by the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon , which will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 3@@ 5,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of market launch , the number of subsequent people exercising every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent jump@@ ed . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for increased performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes to come &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active each day &quot; &quot; shoot on de@@ af ears , because many public messages are bor@@ ed for health and coming from people who look aw@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
whoever drives sports regularly reduces chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it encourages people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships at the hunt .
&quot; as usual there are also mur@@ der@@ ous gam@@ bl@@ ers , which always have to compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have previously been able to track our activity , they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to poker success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the ladies &apos; choir
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
definitely brilliant .
and now finally also an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast proclaimed a multi @-@ combat title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly presented by the silver medal winner A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the Swe@@ de beam during the multi @-@ fight in@@ ales of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ combat title and in total the fifth , while she maintains her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey took place at that moment .
this success puts them in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; the last three years has dominated their sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she was &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ l@@ ete , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; do not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ ts after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign in@@ als of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party of retired man coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of her floor exercises - that includes her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition competition , a series of vic@@ tories that will keep as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina led by two turns , the picture sli@@ pped . &quot;
floating beam and floor ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she went back again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the ste@@ aming bar - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when her gen@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis were expecting - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on cheap red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she strug@@ gl@@ ed around the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke ran to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her practice , she threw kis@@ ses to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is concerned , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ers killed during listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently flew with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who owned one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting took the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; altogether , seven people were killed and two more injured in His@@ panic residence areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ul@@ ses and secured a sphere from the seat as well as sphere fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of its anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t . &quot;
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor cra@@ w@@ l up to his third year and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run and cycle with support .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has imagined for &quot; asking me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs on its own .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional award of an uncertain future .
I always wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
for a long time I was no longer asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; severe ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ds cause rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ area floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency phone on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards reported that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , announced that the inquiries for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches may drop in rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers would flood several houses in the reservoir near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that an altern@@ ating downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these floo@@ ds slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten flows . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09 : 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams have still hat@@ ched people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increased greatly over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we are awake and the water poured and flows in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years , in which she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been substantially weigh@@ ed by the rain since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ds caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and black@@ out in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now floo@@ ded both .
&quot; the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flood water and sand bags for the residents to take @-@ take , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported floo@@ ded , but there were no reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
The@@ Russi@@ an@@ army asser@@ ts it@@ s@@ superi@@ ority in@@ conven@@ tion@@ al@@ war@@ fare
&quot; the police told us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a six year old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents reported that Brown suffered several injuries , including in the lo@@ oming , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pierc@@ ed by spheres , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared the transmitter . &quot;
I just cannot believe this .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reported the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determine whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to be a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , trac@@ ed back to various storm ri@@ fl@@ es , crow@@ ned the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the road , there were tubes . &quot;
&quot; it seems that there have been several armed fighters , who were very active involved , &quot; informed polic@@ emen Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no ar@@ rests and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ section on the arm when she played in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane in front of her house .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still searching for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ ic team in the gym@@ nasi@@ um and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been at every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gym@@ ner@@ sts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , which A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , which is Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ ism , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally mirrors the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and h@@ is@@ panic feminine presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female designers was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion@@ ships of Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered un@@ expect@@ edly , yet master@@ ful gym@@ na@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ battle event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so gym@@ nas@@ tics in the whole country do not see . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to get it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ nas@@ tics crew in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gym@@ nas@@ tics are an expensive sport and that gym@@ na@@ sts are primarily involved in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be res@@ umed as desired . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Simone Bil@@ es , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started with the gym@@ nas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to make the churches au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around . &quot;
I founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years ago .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable sp@@ inning in Harlem for more than 15,000 ur@@ bane teen@@ agers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gym@@ nas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gym@@ nas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to get interested in the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you that so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant physicians want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,@@ 000 assistance physicians , who voted on a election , refused . &quot;
&quot; in July , H@@ unt had un@@ vei@@ led plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekly work in order to improve care for the day @-@ to @-@ day care . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance physicians announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have under@@ gone serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will address the current staff crisis and will admini@@ ster it properly to address all physicians . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through dialogue came to take part in the government for res@@ ign@@ ation and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; it happened that of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had done last month , that his door was always open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , lift up the vibrations and address the wor@@ ries of assistance physicians . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to allow physicians to cover the stri@@ k@@ post chain cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week remun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 Assistant employees subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Staff , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures reach nothing of the only little , but burden already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from professional training , training courses , mutual recognition of the educational plan , education and the gender @-@ specific pay@@ roll in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreement with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine to lower the heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the tin @-@ inhibit@@ ing drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction for individuals with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regul@@ ative authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ative authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form b@@ lows .
&quot; when the day falls apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trig@@ gers , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
&quot; the design of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively helps to reduce further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by presenting Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s pro@@ visional recommendation , we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
the culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ y makes election wars b@@ los@@ som@@ ing in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report for corruption from office
one culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ y has led to the fact that widespread sel@@ ections in Muslim communities are know@@ ingly ignored like a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , attacks the police , ob@@ servers and coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of elec@@ toral abuse due to &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ cities and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an ant@@ ag@@ onal king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ toral cab to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a badge with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; currently , a vot@@ er has to name its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes not to apply removable inks to the finger of a person if they give their vote , in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against elec@@ toral fraud , but is also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special case ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ sk was supposed to be ab@@ used after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had &quot; &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; &quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ist and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; lead &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person cho@@ oses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country .
&quot; he expressed in particular alar@@ ming to the dec@@ eit@@ ful letter of letters , with the elderly members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the guidance of evidence to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been practiced , especially women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani and Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour based on &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ cities and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition of political activists to process mail@@ boxes in order to stop &quot; election harv@@ ests . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is being considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the election list being used for immigration and social bet@@ ting purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a 3 @-@ year limitation on requests for automatic correspondence .
prohibition on political activists to edit full letter codes and envel@@ opes of letter codes .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for elec@@ tive stations .
a change in law that made an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983 .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally asser@@ t that voters go alone in the elec@@ toral cab .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let case no penalty was placed .
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Court found Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty to corrupt and illegal practices for a lit@@ any , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; crash controls &quot; of the elec@@ toral development departments of the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is a proud legacy as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
mad after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic champi@@ ons in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio this week have come across the French bike rider Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of edge and band that proved to be an impressive dou@@ ble@@ man of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by far not the only one to have gold fighting Ath@@ l@@ ete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one can believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which currently fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet showed how a certain arch@@ ery of the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
the crew member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after images on which he looks very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity except for facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy distributed the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it would be a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is said to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming @-@ pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ er@@ in@@ in
&quot; another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , showing similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan bore Adrian by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter @-@ User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the gym@@ nas@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , which resem@@ bles her own wonderful , wide smile that resem@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle . &quot;

&quot; Canadian broadcast@@ er C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ in &quot; &quot; went off &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he was rele@@ asing his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m swimming pool .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought into the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; paint , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; excit@@ edly , he went away like a s@@ wine , and died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the floating aff@@ le 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , allowing the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
fans all over Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shock@@ ed by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ Far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China has been described in the final 4 x 200m swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many asked him

&quot; Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for a short time later , for the commentary by Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a swim performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people respon@@ ding to the Not@@ ice via Twitter
the comment@@ ator &apos;s colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users , compl@@ aining about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
&quot; we regret it sincer@@ ely , that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast them . &quot;
&quot; last night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly to our audience on broadcast and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on her as a person . &quot;
&quot; however , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympic turn , he said . &quot;
&quot; I focused on the performance of the float , not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark reb@@ elled about woman who has sham@@ eless@@ ly under@@ min@@ ed under@@ wear in the midst of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled her clothes in the midst of a mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued browsing and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the store without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled her own ti@@ ghts and pants and ta@@ sted her . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants , which you obviously did not like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything , went back and went out . &quot;
she did not seem to distur@@ b anyone watching or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants which she had ta@@ sted .
&quot; Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with home , who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the garments out of selling after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had it and pulled it out and they were not washed .

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to twist the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , you should first turn around so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the fir@@ ing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with your knees in the bar and turn , while the aggres@@ sor bent off pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they strai@@ gh@@ ten up the weapon . &quot;
&quot; when approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the fir@@ ing line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip , before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ ten the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; however , remember that it &apos;s the saf@@ est thing for a rob@@ ber@@ y to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British travel@@ er under@@ went his immune system and ret@@ ou@@ il@@ ex of a serious test - by using some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k cancelled his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rail@@ ing knob on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before dra@@ ining each object , he used a lumin@@ aire to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought to le@@ ak the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a pull toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he dar@@ ed , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world , and ate strange and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to washing @-@ up kno@@ bs of toilets , the task of the immune system is definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told , &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he received his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .

&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ re number is fresh washed hands less than 60 . &quot;

&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ date produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
&quot; I will not lick here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let us inv@@ oke Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had given up some of the things I have instruc@@ ted to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to le@@ lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty ti@@ db@@ its on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys social housing prior to Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family abandoned her social reward after a dele@@ tion with a damage amoun@@ ting to £ 50,000 , because she had terror@@ ised her neigh@@ bors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ e were thrown after a long list of complaints about their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; having been forci@@ bly removed from their property , they found shock@@ ed employees of the housing association property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls referred to cl@@ atter@@ ing holes , wooden pra@@ w@@ ns were torn , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they now live in private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Housing said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is in@@ famous and its reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who had lived in the apartment temporarily and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted was covered by street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demoli@@ shed , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden pra@@ w@@ ns were torn open . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly forced the police to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall Housing deleg@@ ated her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neigh@@ bors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we put the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not acc@@ ust@@ omed to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had missed the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , called the police at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the Municipal House , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a dele@@ tion is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neigh@@ bors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work done by my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have been brave to us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give sol@@ ace to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after being guilty of the ownership of a class B drug in commercial view .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they are ten@@ ants who do not comply with the house rules .
Angela C@@ row was informed by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that del@@ o@@ ing was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Orion Air@@ plane of the Air Force placed an unbelievable storm flight
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of security . &quot;
this was the moment when the frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ cking jet turned over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military aircraft flew close by the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section of Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing first what was coming through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers that posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added , &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop on me . &quot;

&quot; the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion air@@ plane was on a training flight to identify fisher@@ man boats off the coast , so that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet was slightly deeper than usual due to bad visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where also four people came to death on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply , due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

&quot; hi@@ therto , coach Luis En@@ rique ren@@ ounced a clear decision , leaving Bra@@ vo in the le@@ ague but with T@@ er Ste@@ gen in most other applications . &quot;
before the first mandatory play of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .

mA Long in a separate le@@ ague to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the mark of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympics bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sets and time outs they had no aches at themselves . &quot;
they had pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
after the game gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
mA had to fight only in the first sentence with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo of the plate , leaving Z@@ hang on only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , sufficient breathtaking ball shifts were to be seen nonetheless . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion , Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ rus@@ se was subsequently treated with a doctor . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump grants &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive car@@ es to lose their majority in traditionally conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently working multi @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire spoke as concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after being thrown out of the race 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took up his famous media gle@@ aming . &quot;
rep@@ o @-@ Geschäft ( re@@ purchase agreement )
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his opponents were also accused of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
&quot; in an interview by Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clin@@ tons &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; whether afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened with funding to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans advoc@@ ate more under the arms for Congress . &quot;

the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary commission .
K@@ eni@@ as athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2010 Olympic Games .
&quot; after a fraud test in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately shared a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , passed a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter rotor F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team leader Ken@@ yan by the dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case to strain their own investigations and shared an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will take an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping Control station and went out as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was about 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan &apos;s head of athle@@ tics Michael Rot@@ ich had been with@@ drawn from the Rio games . &quot;
he is alleged to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments in his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has long been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Olympics , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls were pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia should be targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on African land in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics commen@@ ced .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
&quot; in a series of TV reports , the ARD repeatedly raised accus@@ ations that dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sport dec@@ eption . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und last called for a similar study in Kenya , how he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type was nation@@ wide and systematically ged@@ compared . &quot;
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .

&quot; a Musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth night@@ mare with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly on her lover with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; firstly , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman &quot; , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a mon@@ stro@@ us generous person .
and Bart@@ oli back the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;

&quot; they are the same topics , and today they are just as meaningful as it was then . &quot;

&quot; At@@ tor@@ ney Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had prepared to leave the war @-@ torn land and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school ma@@ ids from the east of London went into an air@@ plane to Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

&quot; who does not fit and ano@@ int Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialog and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects short @-@ term asylum seek@@ ers to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term .
&quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the leader of the leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the attempted coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protective guards from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government over@@ took Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds many years ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the dec@@ ei@@ ving put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ position@@ able ethnic Tur@@ ks . &quot;
many will start to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that occup@@ ies refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Staff was indic@@ ting the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the jer@@ k pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been exter@@ min@@ ated or mark@@ eted over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the leader demanded that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria is against Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , a &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics will be held . &quot;
in the last few months I no longer feel safe in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the fire marking as a quality trailer is destroying teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and ano@@ int Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dial@@ ogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper under reference to numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Tur@@ ks already posed the largest group of asylum legitimate asylum detention in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and there@@ with nearly 29 percent of all of them have been eligible for asylum ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find themselves worthy of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum allow@@ ances according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;

the locals who are expected to be convinced by the elec@@ tors are on vacation .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country on the island of Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the farm holiday . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holiday assist@@ ants , the posters hang up , air bal@@ lo@@ ons infl@@ ate , fl@@ yers distribute and count towards the end of voices , only pain@@ fully apply . &quot;
&quot; until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again have an election campaign running over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
what is exciting is how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the co @-@ operation .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame at the blo@@ oming of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create that &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will pres@@ um@@ ably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to show Wielkopolska . German Chancellor Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , that says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the union also has noticed that on the land it crum@@ bles the base , that it must be very severe to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you will find it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ se of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U vot@@ er Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; they have to go where people are : dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last up 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election 2011 , the SPD had yet clearly won with 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the land @-@ day . &quot;
they make up a modern virtue out of their trouble and spread their campaign largely into the internet .

there is nothing to compl@@ ain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those who are responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and finish only at 8@@ pm , there are always praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty much , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no distortion .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; the off@@ ence of those responsible for construction work is also v@@ owed , for instance when it comes to the establishment of accommodation entran@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the village relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asion of the place seems to go back .
&quot; there was some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; &quot; said the dep@@ uty head manager Florian King , responsible for the management of the restructuring . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sc@@ ans were seeking and rather trusted in their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what caused some heavy trucks in residential areas to be fra@@ yed .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called on to intensi@@ fy the sen@@ sing vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation . &quot;
there have already been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 km of hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to revenue collap@@ ses , everyone that is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them . &quot;
&quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; of course &quot; the trav@@ eller is missing . &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we need to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road rehabilitation has thrown back its farm &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dism@@ is@@ sed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt said on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27th now , it must also carry out the dis@@ advantages resulting from the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other districts , where such a bit more generous has been handled . &quot;
&quot; for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t get there , it is also somewhere else nice . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that its core client@@ ele is returning to the end of the renovation work .
&quot; despite the crisis with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the fight against terror , is screw@@ ed to laws . &quot;
&quot; following recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a big security package . &quot;
but what has a dam status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the gro@@ ok@@ er .
&quot; all his suggestions are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not demand anyone .
other further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I am also em@@ powered by this .
&quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , he was able to find results in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère did a little time before drawing up his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the attacks of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and tru@@ ce legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is starting a second stop for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and bra@@ zen ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U man adm@@ its . &quot;
&quot; he still thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything , which has no chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partially in themselves : he plans quick @-@ action for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to det@@ ach people from deport@@ ation .
refugees that are targeted in the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a safety check .
&quot; in the case of dam@@ s for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - such that crimin@@ als commit or disc@@ ard their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some things are still un@@ checked and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of pati@@ ently for example , the question arises : what does this really have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be ques@@ tioned that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in the face of high refugee numbers , many people worried about safety . &quot;
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly pro@@ found@@ ly left the people were not able to compl@@ ain at election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; the sur@@ charges in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election fights . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Union and the SPD are increasingly in position on the topic of internal safety . &quot;
in the past few days there was a high rise between the two parties .
&quot; only a further argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister of Interior , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ors also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling with con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the two @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ discover it is not expe@@ dient .
and with a ban on bur@@ ka he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional on all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in there which could make a fight .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ long itself on the topic of internal security . &quot;
Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes first of all cau@@ ti@@ ously and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance safety .
Volkswagen is still benef@@ iting from Volkswagen .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers increase worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in the recall campaign , there is a whir@@ l@@ wind for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start in the second half @-@ year with the deliveries .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the Volkswagen brand weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sales , as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold fewer cars in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China alone , were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost one six@@ th . &quot;
&quot; head of marketing Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the we@@ aker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a restra@@ int on sale in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the EU withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas escal@@ ates first escal@@ ated , there is also a min@@ us to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the largely affected family @-@ brand of the Lower Saxony is further gli@@ m@@ pf@@ efully through the diesel sc@@ andal . after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to forward a sales increase from January to July , too . &quot;
&quot; at this time Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , the world &apos;s 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust system .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after upgra@@ ding the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer points out a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was in business trips on Friday . &quot;
that is why j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal fin@@ es are .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now considering its German customers a guarantee of ready @-@ to @-@ use diesel models .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the ministry of transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my enquiry commission and the KBA full @-@ volume . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance there are no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption and all type approval relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business circles . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example , customers can come to a workshop half a year after conversion , and this could be trac@@ ed back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that do not have nothing to do with the exhaust gas sc@@ andal , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; that is why VW doesn &apos;t use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in the future pen@@ al interest - a second institute in Germany .
&quot; CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : &quot; &quot; ordinary austerity &quot; &quot; does not need to be afraid of paying for its austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; store banks cash over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
for some time he had 40 million Euros that could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the Bank Director . &quot;
I cannot put 4000 euros for each million .
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now further . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already seen four accidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and inter@@ change@@ ably to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to carry alone , be &quot; economically viable not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore raised their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nation@@ wide fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany is far too strong under banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele equipped with wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ tach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known for the cooperative association of Bavaria , which calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had said at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards Individu@@ als , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition . &quot;
customers in Germany do not want to please this in the width .
destination plates : who bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lon@@ ely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to comment , under the pseud@@ onym no Alle@@ gro of men &apos;s middle age with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the frequently discussed rein@@ car@@ nation of vinyl records is not to be attributed to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to be attributed to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record sellers keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and wild stu@@ ff@@ ed before I stop , keep my hands and a little bit of tim@@ el@@ iness like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o slowly enters into its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers res@@ ide - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I from Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , cl@@ ash the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford when they appeared and re @-@ buy items he sold when he was young and pl@@ agu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets will apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media , people who heard about the com@@ eback , and set themselves to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people generally have to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the Platten@@ revi@@ vals of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers assumed an imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves , from objects that aw@@ oke happy rejo@@ icing . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or pos@@ sessions of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; employs a staff from a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , have not yet stopped . &quot;
&quot; the pol@@ l also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the news report , I would probably look very worried , while using a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men middle @-@ aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy effect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more product @-@ driven , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly arrive . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and women middle @-@ aged . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesi@@ zed and sex@@ @-@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz spo@@ ils from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity at the customers .
&quot; no one of them looks very lon@@ ely , but nour@@ ishing psychological trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window @-@ window as a wholesale purchase .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so collecting disks is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it flo@@ ats with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; as I admit the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ pants look like , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who gather for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cros@@ ley plate player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records . &quot;
&quot; even if my investigations yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , which exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the st@@ rolling through plate stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing ga@@ ze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er , who out@@ stands anything of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to offer 72 pro@@ visional trading in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ cin , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the complimentary meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro@@ visional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais would be absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play much more than just people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids &apos; café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in newcom@@ ers in the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia &apos;s dis@@ appointment : Martin stays fierce

he must analyse in peace which reasons for de@@ bac@@ le would have led .

reinforcement P@@ unch Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s ra@@ ins have to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ urer : in various federal states , including in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ ters will be tested , which should be extra@@ ordin@@ arily effective . &quot;
the fut@@ ur@@ istic enforcement officers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident issues where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway constructions or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary free@@ ze , there is often no infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : his battery lasts for five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , road strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , it is possible to move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to install , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also sh@@ out outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
England wins silver in 7 @-@ star Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by last Thursday night came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten in Rio with a score of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line flow and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it &apos;s probably not that at least one Brit@@ on will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s boss Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let the attacks of GB@@ s boun@@ ce off .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if one would run into running coaches . the World Series W@@ inners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au floo@@ ded in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with more than four minutes of playing , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ yst@@ ro@@ cking T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann @-@ Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua saw a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the revival and there was still a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still st@@ oned . &quot;
it is so .
GB executed fundamental changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anian gap ... for a whole four minutes that was good for the rati@@ os of the first half @-@ time until Joshua was going through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long for the southern cons@@ aner , whose fans sw@@ elled , sw@@ elled flags and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame started the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle b@@ lows the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked off crus@@ hing in the tur@@ f .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the work forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scor@@ ed a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ ous gold than with these games and that wants what is called .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; although there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present when she recru@@ ited the second Olympics in a second without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , at least her 39.@@ 5cm incre@@ mental use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and there was nobody wearing aids more than 30 months ago , as cancer was diagnosed at all . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty terrible situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky to be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start out what the inter@@ ruption held to a minimum , if under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot;
it was an incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing to itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ dying morning to talk a little more than anything else , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Regim@@ ent in an effort in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning won no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t sure to make something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want to make a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time out for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , their own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to just enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
provided for clarity for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
&quot; little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia paid tribute to the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far &quot; &quot; than exemplary . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the team for 31 years , stands behind all this , of which 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water community of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , transports about 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 villages and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; municipalities are municipalities Kirch@@ litz , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
water supply contracts are available for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land acqu@@ isitions in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renovation of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have never been any down@@ time , and there have always been new additions , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blocks for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association regul@@ arily , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
he received a lot of praise and praise for that .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller found his fi@@ anc@@ ée Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a loyal friend .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well as well as the re @-@ structuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment , however , were the rup@@ ture at the high @-@ pressure vessel at Kirch@@ hoff on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages might be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because one filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who joins the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens arising from the industry from the renewable energy sector are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition to the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption , to register . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , now there is a paper statement with the European Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
only when the generators are replaced in the ste@@ el@@ works are an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity production .
thus the status quo of the previous arrangement is largely fixed .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have particular significance .
&quot; with regard to our &apos; Steel is Future &apos; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emission rights trade , climate and employment goals are to be considered , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy , as the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers disc@@ ard Chinese steel corporations price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
&quot; on the one hand , import duties on import reli@@ efs show effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen up . &quot;
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reduc@@ tions .
&quot; in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to close the closing of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , about 86@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced less than six percent less crude steel than in the same period last year as the Steel Community announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she does something good in her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior le@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , described H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular merger , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures arise in old age , a choir is then an ideal occasion to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organise , to be able to leave and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense .
&quot; because in doing so , sen@@ iors do a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly challenge their lungs don &apos;t get out of the d@@ olls in everyday life as quickly as possible .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive emotions of her youth . &quot;
&quot; through song texts and especially melodies , demen@@ tia himself sin@@ ks for long past events . &quot;
&quot; while singing , the head is also required a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
focusing simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; especially older people who live alone , do not just focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler adds . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate , even if he thinks having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views about the choirs in the area .
anyone wishing to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many elderly choirs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;

bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover to determine which effect the cri@@ es of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
&quot; to her surprise , the male also did not let the males get cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the level of exc@@ itation of K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster than k@@ itt@@ ens from k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great need as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
cats react also to the calls from k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the first author of the study , published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the team of researchers had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differenti@@ ate with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a little bit of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ ties that were raised additionally . &quot;
the researchers hold their results despite the small sample for conclusi@@ ve evidence .
&quot; all females , even those who still had no offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speakers if this cri@@ es played off the very excited kit@@ ten .
this ability may be con@@ genital or evol@@ ving with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;

Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ch is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warran@@ t was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ch . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , a major football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of Du@@ eling of the Arch@@ du@@ als between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of normal vou@@ chers , would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
football is not being stopped even before football .
the Prosec@@ ution made an arrest warran@@ t against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ ch .
&quot; according to this , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ me@@ r is supposed to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
&quot; although the state of emergency for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has practically no effect on the lives of most Tur@@ ks . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an agreed on Wednesday for the night &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places throughout the country .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into pend@@ ants and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as &apos; club are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but in view of dramatic experiences in history the groove of the Tur@@ ks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , Cologne demonstrated its sporting value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the end@@ game against fen@@ nel he scor@@ ed the 1 : 0 victory .
the magazine &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say good@@ bye to the Europa League soon . &quot;
&quot; in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it reached only sixth . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as the playing year was better .
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 Seas@@ ons as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rone king . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez and Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as had only been announced to Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after its European vac@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; chief of the club Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storm would have to be ready to refra@@ in from around one third of its excess of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still medals of medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has already been locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other survi@@ ving athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had filed her starting right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly fl@@ atten@@ ed and bled at her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
it offered a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenery : she was still in the hall with a sm@@ iling smile and prov@@ oked her appearance .
&quot; as a feast , that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm . &quot;
but there are many more sports@@ men who go to the Olympic Games in Rio in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was blocked two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than before , it &apos;s over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Rel@@ ay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in a six month lock after taking the pain with O@@ xy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery I had strong tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Championship of 2013 and European Champion of 2010 to 2016 had a positive effect on the banned stim@@ ul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the me@@ ticul@@ ous intake and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and World Champion about 400 m , was positively tested and closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , entered Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world .
ISO @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyr@@ il@@ lic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) mac@@ intosh ( Mac@@ Roman )
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after having been diagnosed with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognised as part of the International Sport Tribunal , won the International Sport Tribunal . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world champion and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 year old world champion , indications of taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the barrier of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran off on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ shell error in Thailand - injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall be in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , explo@@ ded two bom@@ bs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two Spr@@ eng@@ ths went up again , and another man was killed by the authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower bed , the spr@@ inkl@@ er went into the air in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
finally Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g were demanding several injured in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast .
&quot; in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ bs bear the same signature , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ ry@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably it is the action of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks typical of the bom@@ bs of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uph@@ e@@ av@@ al or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , it is assumed that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities kept confidential information on forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still un@@ clear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instruc@@ ted their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are usually not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j over the years .
&quot; after the bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a provinces as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ong and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between the security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no unnecessary travel in these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that bom@@ bs were an attempt to p@@ ave out chaos , while the country moves toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
the military un@@ ta who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest res@@ ists himself to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order .
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago in Bangkok , in a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several sover@@ eig@@ ns , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists have also set the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said Constitutional Officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that &apos;s why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; Un@@ controlled Mass Immig@@ ration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ties &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as he said , his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where they stand , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for your own affair .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports on the contacts of the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; moder@@ ators : Werner , ton@@ i , andi@@ 36 , Tom@@ b@@ stone &quot;
&quot; for the protection of the Constitution , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; looking at the clear increase of illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ assen said , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee quot@@ as or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
but a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rights @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; he expressed concern over the fact that many attacks went to the account of people , who previously did not appear in the right scene . &quot;
this is the concern of concern .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum shel@@ ters were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different , or have elected CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who have radic@@ alized themselves through right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic tendencies . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympics or World records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight float from Ethiopia is so slow that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a recall of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special boot@@ y from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; as in Ethiopia most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first top names made the lap .
some media referred to him as the &quot; ro@@ uble of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; following a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made it funny with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter open style , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool of Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Frei@@ stil alone . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the Neue Platz was stolen .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she returned at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock in the morning , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump considers the im@@ pending elec@@ toral defeat not so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking about an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then drives on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , if it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. television transmitter CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if for him , at the end for reasons of political correctness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; so he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within the party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
postal deliveries in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
the company will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the Post will also offer its electric vehicles on the free car market next year .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been testing for months whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed stretch sco@@ ot@@ ers , with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ Board Jürgen Ger@@ des said , there are always inquiries , such as craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon embar@@ k on mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly and long @-@ term a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we can change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K @-@ leadership dis@@ appears after dis@@ ap@@ pointing financial figures
firm of the Year for Anti@@ trust Baker &amp; Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance
the entran@@ ces suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K could fores@@ ee that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the achievements promised by him . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
GF@@ K Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the management board will take over the board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he will officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; spokes@@ person &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot;
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation .
details wanted to mention a spokes@@ man on Friday .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; on Friday , at the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment on the continued success of the restructuring carried out years ago was great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case at BMW , this would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales rose by 6.1 percent below the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales at 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent . &quot;
earnings in the second quarter were above all deb@@ ited by the company &apos;s sun@@ ken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business segment , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ und in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
&quot; in the event of an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries and reported the police .
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to a request , had to ev@@ ade a truck that was partly on the ri@@ ver@@ side . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people were not able to leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident place on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ told travelers were brought back by a regular bus back to the Kr@@ umm@@ ler district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
&quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot;
the investig@@ ators demanded the cargo experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter will amount to 3.@@ 44 euros ( until now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will increase again later if corresponding improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; according to a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the wast@@ ew@@ ater price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was established that under@@ cover covers for these wast@@ ew@@ ater facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal basis , the market Kas@@ endorf was obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ effective manner . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to grab more deeply into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the committee , a new calculation of fees for wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period may also be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ating rose enh@@ ancements made it possible for all three wast@@ ew@@ ater installations to handle relatively small installations with a very low wast@@ ew@@ ater attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis , expendi@@ tures for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the past calculation period of all three systems , due to its age renovation and repair expenses were noticeable in a considerable scale . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt proved that in the wast@@ ew@@ ater plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the Pump@@ werk W@@ ax@@ les , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led , and at the pond treatment plant L@@ opp had to be extended after nearly 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge has been dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation facility has to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that at the low wast@@ ew@@ ater attack in the three plants the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious according to stone houses , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al wast@@ ew@@ ater @-@ purpose association cannot be extended because it is not defic@@ it facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria posted inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that the inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year were recorded as positive 0.2 % .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Effect cri@@ tici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat lets you create around 150 million daily users that change reality and interact with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders itself to the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting of Roy Licht@@ enstein . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools generating more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have cri@@ tici@@ zed critics in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when there was a filter for some users who gave them s@@ lot@@ y eyes , false teeth and exposed che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; Yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat sh@@ orts that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters rather than car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter reminded of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and said uncomfortable . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the ab@@ ject extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural institution .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ chat &apos;s big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counter@@ parts in matters of race , could rather assume sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ chat filters creates a picture that is ins@@ ul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account , and urged others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ cial contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity in the control practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the majority of white , only male leadership , and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has mostly left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently hired a personnel responsible who focused on sub@@ ju@@ dic@@ ated population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; on their part , Z@@ hu said they closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us . &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when an investigation committee of the Congress passed in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , issued by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Defence Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Wehrmacht , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service anal@@ ysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their ass@@ essments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence @-@ based information , typically dra@@ fted from high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were consistently more positive than analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guiding errors in Cent@@ com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change the reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Refer@@ ences , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than it was the facts , &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military recon@@ quest of the Muslims might start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called Task Force to life after they were assigned that anal@@ ysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com are reports by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence in the country . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an exc@@ essi@@ vely limited process for the creation of intelligence evaluations into IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the inau@@ g@@ ural democr@@ at in the Committee of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Ship , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; &quot; Mr. Ship , &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ ale among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; provided little room for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of an intervention by the White House at the Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was received after complaints from Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokes@@ person , stated that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence greet a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investig@@ ators also have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; but the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State remin@@ is@@ cent of the dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece on how the then government under George W. Bush proce@@ eded against the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker believes that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s , then commander @-@ in @-@ chief , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his exc@@ essi@@ vely positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in the Central Command .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before . &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Hock@@ ey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; but that knows , however , the Americans are at the Olympic competition at 4 @-@ 0 and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will finish the first and second place . &quot;
the first placed will leave the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she did not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we could completely ro@@ b the ru@@ d@@ der .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate rows in the first half of the game with a return hand@@ shake from the near area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and cul@@ min@@ ated the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had a goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel resistant and inevitable , a fran@@ tic relay between competition and pursu@@ it . &quot;
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning stick that is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gym@@ na@@ sts for tri@@ athletes .
&quot; you can not switch on television , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ bors in the queu@@ e in the coff@@ e@@ eshop , without hearing from Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ pl@@ ets , could have been under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsor@@ ing and feel @-@ TV ads , if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even a real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympics . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports that are not univers@@ ally accepted : aerial photo shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline spring has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many who asked me didn &apos;t know that it was an olymp@@ ic port at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA was in competition for competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had a ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who managed it up to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline spring has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ ns school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit , that I am not an expert , but a single enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact , but also the grace of gym@@ nas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially un@@ ites it . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic program according to the design , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another high goal in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympic forecast . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is noble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I have to consider when watching these games as something fati@@ gu@@ ing .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no arch@@ ing into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fishing and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his after air , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long one ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police at fire@@ walls .
is Ethiopia coming to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last few months , protests against the government sha@@ ken the country and spread in more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people ran to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that police officers shot on zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed them .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are pres@@ um@@ ably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Department is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services collabor@@ ate closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets tend to be quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dis@@ si@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or j@@ ail , killed or driven into the v@@ ast@@ ness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
one generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from soil use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following an expan@@ sive election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
anal@@ ysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden are forced to use the tur@@ mo@@ il in recent years and could arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are now explo@@ ding under the surface after years of falling under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians admitted that they were gathered so much to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which from Ethiopia mainly prosp@@ ered , prosp@@ ered in the politics and economy while they exploit the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are under a umbrella to coordinate , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and domin@@ ates in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Africa , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , seemingly fal@@ si@@ fied by the government according to the figures of anal@@ ysts and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was passing relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; the experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and she assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ dic city , managed by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
anal@@ ysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin tigh@@ tro@@ pe walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump asser@@ ts his claim to Obama have been established IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , converting his campaign saying that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication shed new questions on the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sible with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who are trying to take him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump pul@@ ls back on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrary to the previous day , when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump tries to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate would not want to know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the final storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while attempting to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this issue again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already introduced sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he had a strong criticism , when he said that the Russians were to che@@ er Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; according to the way the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe it &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough , so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more estim@@ ating tone , as his demand values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a big advantage in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative pron@@ oun@@ cements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companion to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps of prominent fai@@ ths , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was ques@@ tioned about Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s testimony , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown small organisation , he called them back@@ slider , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the Ma@@ instream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread it aggres@@ sively in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; in front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of sliding on each of his words and being taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , path@@ etic &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats more ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ umps than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; once driven by the price of the market , café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a small café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were ou@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replacing the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , it is also re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide funding for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are shri@@ mp@@ s like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural keys .
the café no longer serves beer because there are fresh ju@@ ices .
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old clients were also besieg@@ ed by Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after closing the club , she gave a while to drink coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that I was lying on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea at that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I got a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has no gru@@ dge that the soap business has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will still deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he prepared to exhibit them soon so that his new neigh@@ bors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto an adjacent building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was devast@@ ated at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; opening the new café , Wh@@ itt was saying that entering the premises and the ordering of a new coffee felt like hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an ample meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined deli@@ ghts of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Sou@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which appears on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sand@@ wich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter was h@@ ack@@ ed , the couple met for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , g@@ inger@@ bread and p@@ opp@@ y bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little che@@ ap@@ ly that stretches out the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have placed itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table served in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet . &quot;
&quot; women &apos;s teams co@@ ached for male field work and it was served fresh baked pat@@ és for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways that the country has moved with it , not to be the cock@@ aig@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central , sharpen@@ ed theme , &quot; Co@@ e alli@@ ed why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le was re@@ confident as &quot; wonderful way of food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; fried Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , since coo@@ ks could hide impro@@ per ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
strange mix@@ es were tried because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - such as the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary politicians &quot; and the challenge to turn p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ meal @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ haus@@ er &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he feeds like the billi@@ on@@ est man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and had a tu@@ x .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to post@@ ulate an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the hi@@ ring of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Ms. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ ar@@ ded as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple had better understood the eating habits of the mother @-@ in @-@ law mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the protection of the wind .
&quot; after the dishes were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e brought out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the plant dessert , which President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it will be called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a nasty trick , modest recipes to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everybody di@@ pped somewhat rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it did not taste bad . &quot;
Co@@ E repeated three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed at bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life into play to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even when the Assad regime was bom@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung claimed almost 60,000 people to life . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 0,000 volunteers use their own lives to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the vision of the group : a video of the Civil Protection , showing him at a 11 @-@ hour saving of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; he has never seen himself as a hero , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack himself , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have pla@@ ited four barrels of barrels above the Alz@@ adia , and it was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; the image quotes his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie mostly comes to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land ha@@ ie only got offspring with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates at a total of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a bul@@ let for a high age . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Grön@@ land@@ hai who could be 39@@ 2 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this life span which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist assumed long that Grön@@ land ha@@ ie become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea from the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her time pent@@ ine measured her when she took six animals with a transmitter in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
&quot; this shar@@ ks nevertheless make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers that tor@@ ch out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins they contain will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks con@@ spic@@ u@@ ously had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as atomic weapons seeking greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , with 220 cm length of third smallest animal , the lens nucle@@ us contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons attempt , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Grön@@ land shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k might be even 39@@ 2 years old at 502 centimet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
&quot; as one of the animals with 39@@ 2 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
also this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
the fact that such meth@@ ad@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured in Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal losing heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on getting as many offspring as possible early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life . &quot;
pre @-@ 1966 A@@ IR@@ C@@ RA@@ FT at Good@@ wood Revi@@ val
&quot; with topics around building , the Municipal Council has dealt primarily in the recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee informed the announcement by mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; at last the marketing of recently designated areas of residence can begin . &quot;
the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the streams in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and dec@@ eit@@ ful sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ vil@@ lige members will be able to report to the town hall as of now , via the allocation of the plots the Municipal Council is expected to advise in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to en@@ force requests for res@@ ett@@ ling other commercial enterprises , together with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the newly created land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Lower @-@ time lar@@ n , the business area designated there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Competence Network Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets are to continue to run from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; it is enough for them to gain approval in the UK . &quot;
these are currently using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Committee ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxemburg had a large fund industry , but also cut off badly with the infrastructure as well as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; says I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business researchers . &quot;
&quot; the power relations : in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead Ob@@ tains legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs , arising from the hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ mis@@ sibility and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the claim on Thursday , U.S. judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the loss of the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to balance Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck tried to su@@ stain each other and claim ownership of lab work to which soft os@@ bu@@ vir ac@@ counted for , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say that they reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
&quot; troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the remaining group of fighters , who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have fre@@ ed over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters who were alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clearing operations , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Minister of Foreign Minister Bill Clinton announced an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on its term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hero@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and reti@@ re@@ es in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not obliged by law . &quot;
&quot; Williams , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his ref@@ usal to check tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the democr@@ ats presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ er , said CN@@ N that he would not permit Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspec@@ tions are not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his ref@@ usal questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business couples and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and released a video on the internet in the high ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump requ@@ esting his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the topic during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election event for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a control examination by IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump is afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s tax return of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike the majority of Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a low @-@ cost index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds were distributed and earnings of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , Fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
environ@@ ment@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by using volunteers in villages in northern Tanz@@ ani@@ as to use a non @-@ violent trial method to protect their homes and harv@@ ests without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many speakers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these congregations , being much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without dam@@ aging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dami@@ an Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth , Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with a fire@@ work body is packed into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition key . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ yed fine dust to ch@@ ill@@ i powder into the air . &quot;
a breath is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a ver@@ der , which sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ work in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director dis@@ rup@@ ts Berliner hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots ex@@ pi@@ red a media record after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israeli preliminary selection , as it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the hotel &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a way to choose Israel from its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it solved in the director even more rage .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is dropped , &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled about this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response from the internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged inv@@ itations of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed &quot; , &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly showed all alle@@ g@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; to not include Israel in the short@@ list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in Sao Paulo &apos;s Brazilian city with the police when they assembled to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on their plans .
&quot; according to the proposal by the governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ zig@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the demonstr@@ ators were seen Gra@@ ffi@@ gel against the temporary president Michel Tem@@ er spra@@ yed on walls .
&quot; the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ is@@ sed by a vote by the Senate on its dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trading environment between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies increased heavily on businesses in the country , the ambassador negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies establish existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; last year Russian foreign representatives attended some 3@@ 5,000 visits , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourist arri@@ vals in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civili@@ sation in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market falling in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y fell on Thursday evening on the drinks market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under amb@@ ush of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces from the employee of the drink market turned out the issu@@ ing of cash and then whis@@ pered at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.70 m tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the drinks market is accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators have to flee towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel parking place situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ derer n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who has made observations about the time ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently contact the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : fun game and fun at summer time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old , with their super@@ vis@@ ors during their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet area of Lei@@ sure , the life @-@ joyful crowd was accommod@@ ated during the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special chil@@ dr@@ ens tour in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days , the group was delighted by the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared cakes , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spo@@ iled . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill @-@ game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people were satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims at the gate of mercy
the demonstr@@ ators from the sea @-@ care unit Ey@@ ne@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna went on a four @-@ day pilgrimage tour from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ ance trip of all the demonstr@@ ators in two years , the Upper Inter@@ minist@@ rant Committee of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage tour . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were examined and decided finally for the Bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the people of Heiligen@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and told the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , we drove by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Our Lady stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was taken from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always rus@@ hed to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song book . &quot;
the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller contributed to the stage targets for a tasty and stronger dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after this , one stepped out of the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous stretch of road , at first had to drop some 500 al@@ ti@@ tudes away and be heard again afterwards . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the doors of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
in the evening mass in Münster the min@@ is welcomed at the pilgrimage destination by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day there was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
&quot; in the afternoon , we went by train to Hor@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ks home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a shock@@ ing victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after they took sixth place in March at the World Championships in London , despite the res@@ ign@@ ation of Ho@@ ys . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an exec@@ utor .
Ho@@ ys retirement has produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton were trying to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now developed . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner compet@@ ed in the qualification rounds an Olympic team , but in the stand@@ still rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front , and Sk@@ inner stopped . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , driving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climb@@ ed on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and give me a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up a Olympic team and the World Champion was defeated . &quot;
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys site there was a hint that after a weak start he dropped off on the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such a superior win , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; it feels like the UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ ys , it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y , who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y alike .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ell qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had argued with representatives before the qualification when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
&quot; in the corresponding Women &apos;s Competition , continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team rel@@ ies on his strong web team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a pair of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; there were drama in the background , such as the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex and b@@ ingo b@@ uns , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like the now legendary call GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated . &quot;
future of the melting shop of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of energy demand
&quot; the future of the aluminum mould of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , and thus all delivery contracts will be lifted , as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is scheduled to run in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations at the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ oes , as the sm@@ el@@ ting consum@@ es about 10 percent of the total power generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which last year led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting shop with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties should be so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which will come into force since November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L expects the tre@@ aties to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by predic@@ ting the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; &quot; expectation of a termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to reserve the contracts , the &quot; Sk@@ ill of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it ended 2010 a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into force from November this year even though it is not yet guilty of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
anal@@ ysts warned of the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Smith Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land would consume about 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts each year and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , scre@@ ened reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; this is the cli@@ mati@@ cally heated story of nearly every birthday of a children &apos;s shipment ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take her other girls to participate in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the V@@ ogue , a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim loves her as regards the V@@ ogue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most sold issue of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles an illustrated book as a fashion journal , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Bre@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of its cover stars is expected to se@@ ep in the last two years of the magazine before the official announcement .
&quot; women , who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , falls under the previous category , it is in good society . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been publishing Lem@@ on@@ ade for one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
with its reality @-@ TV @-@ story J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ ings of the moment . &quot;
these feelings just cooked high when the message came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but lashing around on the m@@ ist seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is to be seen in Reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; about 16@@ 0,000 people annually exhibit &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the emergency con@@ fig@@ s of the country are rejected annually by the local authorities , while the industry insi@@ sts on the impact of further cuts on over@@ bur@@ dened transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ inqu@@ ishing and similar - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly busy , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of the Community Law Centr@@ es of Que@@ esland James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey conducted by the National Association of Common Typ@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s common bush centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need to be denied , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families that have been dism@@ is@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dism@@ is@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Federal Prosec@@ utor and the Federal Minister of Justice , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to immediately aboli@@ sh these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in legal issues . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the common bush centres and their customer communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Break@@ ing Camp@@ aig@@ n indic@@ ted by employee re@@ port@@ edly
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been indic@@ ted because of alleged in@@ action , after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had sent a fire@@ arm to a staff while in February they were in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at Charlotte Bord@@ ini &apos;s regional court , a former software programmer for the campaign in this Federal State . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini waited for months to have waited for the matter to be regulated in the internal state before he realised that &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini announced in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compl@@ aining with the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini concluded that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; Bord@@ ini announced . &quot;
&quot; only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate met a tur@@ mo@@ il , when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms @-@ friends - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; it was clear that the media had torn his words out of the context , and that he would not go to violence . &quot;
he calls for damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and abi@@ ding spiritual damage .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
try to contact Philip beat as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls at his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) have considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties .
this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black governing coalition could not be governed in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD collap@@ sed from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was just slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens returned to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.8 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey amounted to only 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; in this way , they still lay behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would represent at least 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; initially , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with a minimum of 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to the stores exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they origin@@ ate somehow from the stone age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; &quot; office in western format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new cell phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , communic@@ ator was available . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible via an HTML browser even though ag@@ oni@@ zing slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the cell phone could be worked like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 39@@ 2 euros in 2015 .
nobody could susp@@ ect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates suppliers that came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , were sold by 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ going deals of the countless App vendors and the telec@@ om companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry was developed around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the time . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with a touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the tri@@ umph@@ al march of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had a look . &quot;
&quot; finally , you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we ran a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we will be alone 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blow on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ unders were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn , and a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and all the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two busy walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Mouse Play &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display flags on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding for his advertisements to complic@@ ate the recognition of what part of the page advertising is to complic@@ ate . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ fight between the time @-@ breaking open source community and the enc@@ ir@@ cling have already been underway since the invention of advertising block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is soon coming with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , use some 200 million people adverti@@ sers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has other ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a large amount of income , so Facebook can see the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; Ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we concentrated on developers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
leave a woman in pres@@ umed suicide on the Swiss fre@@ eway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a pres@@ umed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud short after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 , who was over@@ riding several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; several drivers have been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , who asked them , and every witness of the incident , told them to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a colli@@ sion prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers cannot be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent kill@@ ings after having passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 , near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become un@@ conscious on the road , took judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court realized that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- came to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation &quot; , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could have applied similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and yet progres@@ sed slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet pres@@ um@@ ably pointed to more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus ex@@ poses its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought about a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary researchers .
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years , exposed to excessive heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect returned -- Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led a minor competi@@ tor to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth , that it requires and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched with the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had been fired on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick told me this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference to return five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame go@@ al@@ keeper Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .

&quot; the labour struggles with regard to the remun@@ eration for North Sea workers are exposed , while all the armed forces sit at the table for a new round of talks , said the negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group , as well as the un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions , can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ initiate the decision process of the current dispute , &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year , in order to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company are giving the space required to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has been dism@@ is@@ sed for its part thousands of people and plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ at@@ oc@@ clusi@@ on with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Scottish parliam@@ ent@@ arian Dave Anderson had met with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the greatest work disputes which took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ loops of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ pile rotate to different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods with the planet formation stand .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Im@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light @-@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which were created around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars encounter large amounts of star@@ vation . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow@@ ing effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star@@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
&quot; pull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars of slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes turn as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the Ballet &apos; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be mass@@ aging , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars can slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported on their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial basketball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez as the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional res@@ ign@@ ation , the 41 year old professional will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the 41 year old pro on August 12th . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has aver@@ ted 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future be a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es created some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the bas@@ eball hall of the bas@@ eball . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have been banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect for years to have received high @-@ performance funding over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time swe@@ pt . &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got aff@@ inity with the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Go@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive sound test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not start off in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
an ath@@ l@@ ete ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ ste@@ ep@@ le ste@@ ep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian aimed inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the cri@@ tically question@@ able athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to the unknown . &quot;
&quot; for Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
on Friday afternoon the International Sports Court of CAS confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old paid the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events of over 50 m Freestyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing . &quot;
&quot; the national association &quot; &quot; take the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands a full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will co @-@ operate with the International Sport Tribunal and accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive himself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said this &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; be innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the forbidden substance of the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already have a positive effect . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v spoke immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weight lif@@ ters from the Chr@@ onic dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Go@@ in@@ sky &quot; was also known , the London Olympics Champion in the class until 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; however , both of them are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had banned the whole Russian team , except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous trials in China had also caused severe disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang , pink li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French Radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun was at the center of a confron@@ tation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested on the stim@@ ul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ ac@@ acia in 2014 , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;

program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware removal specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims pay readily the solvents required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ out software according to the observations made by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes rather on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for the ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the pa@@ inters were still designed to send advertisement . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first , private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks resulted in a frigh@@ tening fast in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works with a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case , people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to get more money . &quot;
&quot; they declare their sacrifices via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if individuals are rede@@ emed by payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate a hard negoti@@ ation and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to return their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is likely that these are three or four people . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ant software then in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the up @-@ to @-@ date malware repair kits have been created by using malware , providing advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums underground , buying the set from a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als are in charge of sp@@ amm@@ ing with spreading , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 per cent of the companies @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey are proud to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful acquisition , the perpetr@@ ator instead threat@@ ens the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; according to the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Def@@ con event , safety researchers demonstrated how to get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe , and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V appears to be small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear ; it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit of the cockpit is falling off . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceilings . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
he is likely to make his work sof@@ ter .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
there is another engine : a 1.5 liter gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; in the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( working at a speed of 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the lane assistant . &quot;
the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses a lot of obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
very reliable is the remote beam assistant .
and the intelligent controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if needed .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , na@@ vi , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not responsible : fall on Air@@ line Bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
&quot; liability is only conceivable with risks that are typical for air traffic , the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf appe@@ aled ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a squ@@ e@@ eze in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay damages to the man .
illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers will only get money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly apparent in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the tra@@ ffi@@ cked case , a family was severely ill in diarr@@ he@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ mat@@ ing . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective sewage treatment which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the purification plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; since in the samples of the water , no contamination has been found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and at the same time react to terrorist threats .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and divisions . &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , this is the level of security and also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement proposals up to the 2017 parliamentary election .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in mid @-@ four order magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism needs to be punished once more . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce is to be am@@ ended so that the purchase of weapons is more difficult on the internet . &quot;
the recently discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should continue to be preserved after de Mai@@ zi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions on how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said , with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister considers better social support . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD head Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior expressed clearly against ac@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; that was an ear tag for the Schar@@ f@@ makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship before .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is un@@ constitutional .
&quot; you cannot ban everything you refuse , and I reject the bur@@ q@@ as . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Simone Peter rejected the minister that he wanted to sim@@ ulate with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act with vig@@ or and capacity .
&quot; lef@@ tist Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Spr@@ ü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay will no longer bring people security in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway exit
it st@@ umps on a regular basis on the circum@@ fer@@ ential road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right @-@ off balance should be extended . &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the environmental road every night in the traffic jam if they drive over the highway junction Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the Wes@@ er Strasse , the right lane by 700 meters . &quot;
mot@@ orists can then go directly from the Hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic con@@ stru@@ cts early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district &apos;s representative Münster @-@ West .
the train ride on the feeder urge drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return traffic goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer possesses the required load @-@ carrying capacity to record two @-@ lane lifting in particular .
the competent state company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the resul@@ t@@ ful traffic could continue .
&quot; however , years have to be reck@@ oned with : the bridge has an official residual term until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal balance , the state company deliberately chose the low @-@ traffic period in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will be tra@@ cked on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Kinder@@ haus Wald@@ schule has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s Association , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class had come from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will receive the opportunity to attend professional guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language medi@@ ation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ry sky : hope for improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ sni@@ pe Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night for Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good then we see many stars in the sky .
&quot; the star @-@ shed is about Per@@ sei@@ ds , which at 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they appear to emerge from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening one walks around etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is far from the wake ring no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you are in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not recre@@ ative . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are various reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter we@@ eb , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ ming and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; however , what one actually understands is the in@@ som@@ nia , so it is a sleeping and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; many people just feel asleep as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines can be stuck . &quot;
not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; says we@@ eb . &quot;
and it may be that different factors require each other .
&quot; for example , those who have a sli@@ pped disc can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly cat@@ ches to sal@@ ute all day problems and wor@@ ries , shooting an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one become a doctor with in@@ som@@ nia ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week , should go to the doctor , take revenge . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look very different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ingo Fi@@ etze , director of the interdisciplinary sleep @-@ medical center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , stresses : &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should first contact the primary doctor in case of sleep problems . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for exam@@ ining in the sleep laboratory , medical doctors recommend snor@@ ing with respiratory replac@@ ers , in case of path@@ etic ti@@ red@@ ness , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the pan@@ eling , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on your finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera draws on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can suff@@ erers get a grip on ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sit for a better sleep .
&quot; shooting counts : regular sleep and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television to sleep , avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve at all . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler sold himself on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a &apos;s short @-@ ground world champion@@ ships and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ assem@@ bler , via Facebook , has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues standing in the cri@@ tique . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion will receive 20,000 € reward and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised about missing medals , &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the subject of dop@@ ing , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bles had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; whoever does not take a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election Hamburg , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of luggage det@@ ained
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects committed several pocket and luggage ste@@ els as gang members .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport met a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past thi@@ eves .
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several deli@@ ghts since the middle of July , and were professionally done professionally and professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Police Department of 34 can demonstrate four acts , specifically for the off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a remnant of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not work at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a refreshing kinder@@ garten and a beer shop . &quot;
on the facade of a gray house someone jump@@ ed &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot;
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed , is already being built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be built . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; known as the respective real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in , is preferably illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented apartments , on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a strong police action against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owners of the house . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers removed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain wor@@ m late . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is attrac@@ ting three children , is anno@@ yed above all by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising mi@@ ths and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left . &quot;
the dit@@ ch that the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police divide between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours does not exist .
&quot; in contrast to the rest of the city , Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district . &quot;
&quot; Haus@@ bes@@ etz@@ ungen and the resulting living projects have long been part of the neighborhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire main@@ z street very close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was admitted to a regular street battle in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and ball@@ ers from all over the world over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on the raised pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown with color @-@ bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crime rates such as bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences constitute tangible damages , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ement house for 17 years beside the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ ghty : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to be . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will no longer exist in Riga anymore .
&quot; for the studied architecture she is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more apart than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously pulled into the Riga street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore it was so important for her to get back to her street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the Deut@@ anten@@ oh@@ eit across the bor@@ ough . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through si@@ ghted new buildings in former buildings , which sup@@ plant the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are actually con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well infected , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never stops ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who run should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area that can badly compl@@ ain about noise .

Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gic team assi@@ sts the team of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else ming@@ led . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group implies that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the hur@@ rying Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ culous than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant , when administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , was just an aff@@ ection@@ ate Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
responsibility changes from the administrative office of the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t work so far , so it was necessary to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be not@@ orious as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are set up in the W@@ as@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments is it not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine says . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help master master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive side effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so there is administration and volunteers here .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; however , problem cases exist , says customer frank@@ ly , &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : are the two fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent happ@@ enings , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine says quite clearly what some nai@@ ve might call it . &quot; a residual risk can and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins brought them completely into ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so major and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region .
they are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants would soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the primi@@ tives are already busy to integrate the previous human beings in a reasonable way .
&quot; currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
please inform the author of that page about the error .
