<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues sought a little variation with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they chased in fast gallop at home to the feed arches."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the equestrian career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he settled with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even shave for photography."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports team handed over to the man from Anhausen on a small gala the Gold Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="16">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the Sports Pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has promoted the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of EUR 25,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"TYPO3 is an open source content management system. to maintain the quality of the system and to improve it, please help us by donating. TYPO3 CMS."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are not aware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, it would be quite different, claiming Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively repay regulations, and he is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in that need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost immediately say."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump you could get party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-operate coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand renewables with its investment programme:" a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpiring trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both Americans do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, for example, Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a cheat.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase her to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he's not going to be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the taxation policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton who wants to demand at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every fucked woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until it realises that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-run women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men there - not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope-bearer." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"there are other reasons for women to flee:" "many steal secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, volunteerism, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experienced, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help themselves, more accommodations are needed only for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is such a thing in accommodations of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are floors or own houses for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are home separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women stay together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much women feel this protective need, can be read at the rush, which there is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since he has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy of the Assistants have called their union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures starting in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that the ministers agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant physicians and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently quiet "to problems, which resulted in the agreement to be rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official re-accession to all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Bureau today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating work combat measures starting at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistants of this year strike six times, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">Head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Johann Malawana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after the vote, the Minister of Health said Jeremy Hunt, that the contract for physicians in England would be forced into force."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg palace, I can't forbid the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed stallied, and he spared very little heat, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin stated and accused Ankara to have Russia fallen into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media held a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"seriously, the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed almost his ministry last month with a failed state coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, State television predicts cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Veejsti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted coup of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - he picks out to benefit from the cool moods and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that even a deep-seated fear of the regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent an" alliance of outsiders ": two countries who are driven away from the West and feel badly treated, and now fade away."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents met at the press conference that they hadn't even strove the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately chose to answer a question of their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey shouted the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once more."</seg>

<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state as regards bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who was once touted as a potential president at once wanted to direct Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complaining for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin arrived in power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, Putin's closest ally, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closings to the" ceiling blowers, "which are approaching completion at each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economics Keith Brown entered the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the sealing shows trendsetting high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last street deck and its connection with the northern tower remaining in the expansion, we had to close the gap left on the north or the shore."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the viaduct is 222 feet long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team worked, tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweig cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: investors should be taken much more seriously in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 beneficial apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "action concept living" at the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann means:" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban surfaces must in future exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big right of strike in the town hall is, however," "Bratmann:" "how do you deal with investors looking for private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions of dollars and needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratman:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to satisfy even harder requirements for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"notwithstanding this, as a violinist, a tightening of the situation on the housing market is reflected."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the programme is not entirely new: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of some 1300 favourable apartments, whose funding will be implemented over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planners" planners Nicole Palm, should now be bought out-going bonds of the city. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western town the deadlines run at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western town is increased dramatically, one removes from the aim of the so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be no movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>

<seg id="1">"Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children don't go outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens, was lamented by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for videogames in the 1990ies (later resulting from a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that overburdened the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon, which will be tracked with a GPS and, once found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile) or" captured "can be captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of market launch, the number of subsequent people exercising every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent jumped."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increased performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health, people want to take" 30 minutes to come "from the sofa" and "to be active each day" "shoot on deaf ears, because many public messages are bored for health and coming from people who look awning."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives sports regularly reduces chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it encourages people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships at the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as usual there are also murderous gamblers, which always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have previously been able to track our activity, they gave us no reason to exercise sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to poker success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activism in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtakingly on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Definitely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast proclaimed a multi-combat title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly presented by the silver medal winner Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles contests on the Swede beam during the multi-fight inales of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-combat title and in total the fifth, while she maintains her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey took place at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"the last three years has dominated their sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she was" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"they expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment."</seg>

<seg id="20">"Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of retired man coordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation mark."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true."</seg>
<seg id="22">A part of her floor exercises - that includes her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">"this girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip to the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman."</seg>
<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will keep as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even though Mustafina led by two turns, the picture slipped."</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beam and floor urns - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she went back again with 15,433 on the steaming bar - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was one on it."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her gently when her gendergbnis were expecting - a pure formality - and tears flowed on cheap red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she struggled around the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake ran to Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team of men, called" Oma, "had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her practice, she threw kisses to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12 year old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently flew with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of a predator, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, who owned one of the adult victims."</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting took the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"altogether, seven people were killed and two more injured in Hispanic residence areas within four months."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is happening in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissant from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln."</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later."</seg>
<seg id="12">"liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site."</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it wasn't unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="2">"like most of the 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother."</seg>
<seg id="3">"but as the least of its antiquity, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder, about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy."</seg>

<seg id="9">Some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalise it.</seg>
<seg id="10">"my first answer was' I didn't know people still do, 'explained Picciuto."</seg>

<seg id="12">Edmund was neither able to sit nor crawl up to his third year and he still cannot speak.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he is slowly making progress.</seg>
<seg id="14">It can run and cycle with support.</seg>

<seg id="17">"we bring him sign language," "said Picciuto CBS News."</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is not a typical sign language -- it says. Edmund has invented some signs on its own.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic such as Edmund and infection with viruses such as measles or the ciavirus during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Symptoms and prognoses may vary greatly.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus infected.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto is reminiscent of the emotional award of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I always wondered what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What will happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still doesn't know.</seg>

<seg id="15">"Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Gloster."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, increased greatly over night."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we are awake and the water poured and flows in," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years, in which she lived there."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Hansford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities, and he was the only one who can swim."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie "</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's olympic team in the gymnasium and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been at every summer olympiade since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnersts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, which Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, which is Catholicism, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified black and hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female designers was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world championships of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpectedly, yet masterful gymnatics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-battle event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but so gymnastics in the whole country do not see."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit the same path as Aly and Madison to get it into the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnastics crew in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and that gymnasts are primarily involved in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). the list can be resumed as desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to make the churches aun innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing a more affordable and easy-to-reach turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"for my events, we have offered free and affordable spinning in Harlem for more than 15,000 urbane teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by the Holen of the olympic team golds and thank you that so many young girls are motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="17">"employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as sending, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from professional training, training courses, mutual recognition of the educational plan, education and the gender-specific payroll in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreement with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">The culture of the Political Correcy makes election wars blossoming in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year on dismissal of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">One culture of the Political Correcy has led to the fact that widespread selections in Muslim communities are knowingly ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, attacks the police, observers and councils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to" oversensitivity to ethnicities and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and communal government, who is now an antagonal king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cab to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a badge with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"currently, a voter has to name its name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes not to apply removable inks to the finger of a person if they give their vote, in order to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special case ruled that the acting mayor Lutsk was supposed to be abused after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had" "perverted" "the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in cynical manner" "and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobic accusations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman should" "lead" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religous duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation where one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"he expressed in particular alarming to the deceitful letter of letters, with the elderly members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guidance of evidence to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" as proof, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been practiced, especially women and young people, in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions have unknowingly ignored such behaviour based on "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicities and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke to 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition of political activists to process mailboxes in order to stop" election harvests. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration tests to prevent the election list being used for immigration and social betting purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone chooses twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional.</seg>

<seg id="31">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the elective stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees generally assert that voters go alone in the electoral cab.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlet case no penalty was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Electoral Court found Lutsk Rahman and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices for a litany," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "crash controls" of the electoral development departments of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud legacy as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to twist the skewer for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and go out of the firing line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then beat him with your knees in the bar and turn, while the aggressor bent off pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they straighten up the weapon."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"simultaneously shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip, before moving backwards and straighten the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent his immune system and retouilex of a serious test - by using some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cancelled his course on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a railing knob on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before draining each object, he used a luminaire to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to leak the rinsing knob of a pull toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he dared, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world, and ate strange and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to washing-up knobs of toilets, the task of the immune system is definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told," As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he received his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His proofs had a luminometer average of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometre number is fresh washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after their Luminometer was over 4000 units, while freshly-washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validate produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not lick here, because it is disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let us invoke Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had given up some of the things I have instructed to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lelick her and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty tidbits on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebile were thrown after a long list of complaints about their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"having been forcibly removed from their property, they found shocked employees of the housing association property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls referred to clattering holes, wooden prawns were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that they now live in private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who had lived in the apartment temporarily and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was covered by street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and curses."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found"</seg>

<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly forced the police to be invoked.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delegated her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogification was cheered by facilitated neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't care about anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we put the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had missed the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, called the police at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the Municipal House, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a deletion is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, since the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have been brave to us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give solace to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of money after being guilty of the ownership of a class B drug in commercial view.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they are tenants who do not comply with the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow was informed by the police of Devon and Cornwall that deloing was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without reproaches and those who have been harmed by such a behavior," "she said."</seg>

<seg id="6">"at short notice, I reckon tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protective guards from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition," "says the president of Ali Toprak of the" "world" "on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government overtook Kurdish strongholds many years ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the deceiving putsch, there are still secular and oppositionable ethnic Turks."</seg>

<seg id="12">Erdogan wants to increase the jerk pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>

<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the farm holiday."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: in the holiday assistants, the posters hang up, air balloons inflate, flyers distribute and count towards the end of voices, only painfully apply."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until the 4th of September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again have an election campaign running over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if one can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, since 1998 strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame at the blooming of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create that "accelerates the rise of right-wing populists, which will presumably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to show Wielkopolska. German Chancellor Merkel is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, that says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the union also has noticed that on the land it crumbles the base, that it must be very severe to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you will find it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanse of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU voter Kokert to his comrades is also self-revealing:" they have to go where people are: dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party has to be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last up 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just ahead of AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election 2011, the SPD had yet clearly won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the land-day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make up a modern virtue out of their trouble and spread their campaign largely into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those who are responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and finish only at 8pm, there are always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty much," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no distortion.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the offence of those responsible for construction work is also vowed, for instance when it comes to the establishment of accommodation entrances."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasion of the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there was some considerable discomfort," "said the deputy head manager Florian King, responsible for the management of the restructuring."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many scans were seeking and rather trusted in their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What caused some heavy trucks in residential areas to be frayed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called on to intensify the sensing vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself informed about the situation. "</seg>
<seg id="17">There have already been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way with 77 km of hour in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27-rehabilitation has led to revenue collapses, everyone that is asked to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" "end customer", "i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for them."</seg>
<seg id="25">"at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" most slight decline, "but also admits that" of course "the traveller is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most strongly exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have hit" hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We need to be glad about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"at" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"the road rehabilitation has thrown back its farm" "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt said on a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27th now, it must also carry out the disadvantages resulting from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER knows from other districts, where such a bit more generous has been handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"for all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't get there, it is also somewhere else nice."</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that its core clientele is returning to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crisis with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="3">But what has a dam status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the grooker.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his suggestions are politically reasonable to the coalition partner," says the Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not demand anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am also empowered by this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as the Minister of the Interior, he was able to find results in a" recoverable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière did a little time before drawing up his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot has already been announced, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the attacks of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and truce legislation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière is starting a second stop for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and brazen jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"that will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still thinks this is reasonable and doesn't demand anything, which has no chances in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partially in themselves: he plans quick-action for deportations and more opportunities to detach people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees that are targeted in the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of dams for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such that criminals commit or discard their papers in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things are still unchecked and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of patiently for example, the question arises: what does this really have to do with certainty and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be questioned that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in the face of high refugee numbers, many people worried about safety."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that profoundly profoundly left the people were not able to complain at election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the surcharges in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are election fights."</seg>
<seg id="35">"therefore, the Union and the SPD are increasingly in position on the topic of internal safety."</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days there was a high rise between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a further argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions Minister of Interior, in which the Ressortors also demand a Burka ban and a reversal of the double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling with conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a reversal of the two-pass, he doesn't hold anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To rediscover it is not expedient.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a ban on burka he has constitutional objections.</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is unconstitutional on all corners and whether it is" reasonable "for the coalition partner, it must first show itself."</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot in there which could make a fight.</seg>
<seg id="45">"however, the SPD is currently trying to prolong itself on the topic of internal security."</seg>

<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho slowly enters into its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers reside - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged) to Reckless Records (data: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), clash the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford when they appeared and re-buy items he sold when he was young and plagued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was a bit too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who heard about the comeback, and set themselves to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people generally have to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the Plattenrevivals of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers assumed an impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves, from objects that awoke happy rejoicing."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "employs a staff from a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, have not yet stopped."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the poll also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried, while using a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men middle-aged) has noticed a" trophy effect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-driven, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly arrive."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle-aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesized and sex@-@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz spoils from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity at the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"no one of them looks very lonely, but nourishing psychological traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-window as a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve a lot, so collecting disks is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of plates is... "it floats with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"as I admit the jeans-Hotpants look like, I watch a group of young teenage girls who gather for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crosley plate player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my investigations yielded that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, which exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the strolling through plate stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while they avoid the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who outstands anything of middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to offer 72 provisional trading in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energycin, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the complimentary meals that are offered by the state supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais would be absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play much more than just people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that" "the closure" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in newcomers in the course of the summer. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby last Thursday night came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten in Rio with a score of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line flow and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it's probably not that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis's boss Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let the attacks of GBs bounce off.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one would run into running coaches. the World Series Winners went up 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau flooded in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with more than four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right hand corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a hystrocking Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann-Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua saw a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the revival and there was still a minute of playing... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided through further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still stoned."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is so.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB executed fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijianian gap... for a whole four minutes that was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua was going through Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long for the southern consaner, whose fans swelled, swelled flags and danced on the grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame started the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle blows the fijis hugged and GB kicked off crushing in the turf.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the work forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team secured the prize - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinous gold than with these games and that wants what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"although there were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present when she recruited the second Olympics in a second without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, who put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolute, at least her 39.5cm incremental use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was nobody wearing aids more than 30 months ago, as cancer was diagnosed at all."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty terrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky to be treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start out what the interruption held to a minimum, if under such circumstances is the correct term."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing to itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-dying morning to talk a little more than anything else, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an effort in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it repeats only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning won no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't sure to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want to make a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time out for one year before making decisions about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to just enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="10">"the drinking water community of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports about 150,000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 villages and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for further cities and municipalities.</seg>

<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisational skills, the budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," "said the chairman."</seg>
<seg id="15">"as outstanding events she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land acquisitions in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control (2004) and the renovation of water pipes."</seg>

<seg id="26">"here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages might be supplied with water."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens arising from the industry from the renewable energy sector are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition to the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers, the gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption, to register."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said to the WAZ, now there is a paper statement with the European Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks are an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, this will not be raised in the steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus the status quo of the previous arrangement is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have particular significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our 'Steel is Future' campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emission rights trade, climate and employment goals are to be considered," "said IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to intensify, as the world's largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers discard Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties on import reliefs show effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen up."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry Primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the end, ThyssenKrupp also did not want to close the closing of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, about 860,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced less than six percent less crude steel than in the same period last year as the Steel Community announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the produced quantity went back the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production is by two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"at the same time, she does something good in her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, described Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular merger, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal occasion to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to arrange and organise, to be able to leave and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense.</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in doing so, seniors do a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly challenge their lungs don't get out of the dolls in everyday life as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of Senior Citizens Organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive emotions of her youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through song texts and especially melodies, dementia himself sinks for long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people who live alone, do not just focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler adds."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate, even if he thinks having little talent, Lenz advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews about the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone wishing to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many elderly choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you have no access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">"to her surprise, the male also did not let the males get cold - however, they behaved always the same in contrast to the females."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the level of excitation of Katzenbabys at the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="6">Cats react also to the calls from kittens - but always the same.</seg>

<seg id="8">"she is the first author of the study, published on this Friday in the journal" "BMC Evolutionary Biology". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous study, the team of researchers had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differentiate with the urgency of their neediness."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight queens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a little bit of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kitties that were raised additionally."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers hold their results despite the small sample for conclusive evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who still had no offspring, reacted to the cries," "said Konerding."</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the loudspeakers if this cries played off the very excited kitten.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be congenital or evolving with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have responded at all," "said the biologist."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby noises in humans."</seg>
<seg id="19">"some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, regardless of whether they were mothers or not, biologist Marina Scheumann reported."</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks typical of the bombs of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist upheaval or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>

<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities kept confidential information on forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that bombs were an attempt to pave out chaos, while the country moves toward stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>

<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympics or World records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight float from Ethiopia is so slow that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a recall of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates at the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special booty from the international swimming pool.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as in Ethiopia most sportsmen run, Habte simply wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soon the first top names made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as the "rouble of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"following a" "prosperity" "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "made it funny with" "Dad Bod". ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter open style, played there no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool of Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a pre-run over 100 metres of Freistil alone."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired back then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat lets you create around 150 million daily users that change reality and interact with identities in such a way that borders itself to the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting of Roy Lichtenstein."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unblurred, self-propelled tools generating more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have criticized critics in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when there was a filter for some users who gave them sloty eyes, false teeth and exposed cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" "Yellow-face." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shorts that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of injurious clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widespread over the photos that the filter was" hurtful and said uncomfortable. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the abject extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural institution.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">"and Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterparts in matters of race, could rather assume sensitivity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchat filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "it is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed than it used to be," "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account, and urged others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the control practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the majority of white, only male leadership, and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has mostly left Snapchat unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company has recently hired a personnel responsible who focused on subjudicated population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>

<seg id="5">"intelligence-based information, typically drafted from high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were consistently more positive than analysis of other intelligence services," "quoted a newspaper article."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The guiding errors in Centcom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command References, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than it was the facts," "stated the report."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom was publicly known that a military reconquest of the Muslims might start in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans called Task Force to life after they were assigned that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom are reports by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in the country."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an excessively limited process for the creation of intelligence evaluations into ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the inaugural democrat in the Committee of Representatives, Adam B. Ship, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," "Mr. Ship," "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "said the morale among analysts and" "provided little room for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of an intervention by the White House at the CentCom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, which was received after complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence greet a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigators also have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"but the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminiscent of the disagreements of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece on how the then government under George W. Bush proceeded against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team around Mr. Hooker believes that the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>

<seg id="21">"she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and culminated the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guided tour."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rio de Janeiro's events feel resistant and inevitable, a frantic relay between competition and pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stick that is passed from the wristband to the swimmers to the gymnasts for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch on television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the coffeeshop, without hearing from Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimplets, could have been under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsoring and feel-TV ads, if it would be a swimmers, turner or even a real."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports that are not universally accepted: aerial photo shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline spring has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many who asked me didn't know that it was an olympic port at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA was in competition for competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had a athlete until 2012, who managed it up to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline spring has some outsiders, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit, that I am not an expert, but a single enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact, but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic program according to the design, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"forty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and down, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also another high goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic forecast."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I have to consider when watching these games as something fatiguing.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no arching into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"qualifying and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fishing and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his after air, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long one ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at firewalls.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia coming to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last few months, protests against the government shaken the country and spread in more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people ran to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the response of the government was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police officers shot on zig unarmed demonstrators and killed them.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Department is now calling for a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets tend to be quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents have been effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or jail, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from soil use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following an expansive election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden are forced to use the turmoil in recent years and could arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of falling under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were gathered so much to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, which from Ethiopia mainly prospered, prospered in the politics and economy while they exploit the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are under a umbrella to coordinate," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and dominates in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and to use special officers to process opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Africa, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, seemingly falsified by the government according to the figures of analysts and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest was passing relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amhardic city, managed by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump asserts his claim to Obama have been established ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy on Friday, converting his campaign saying that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founder "of the Islamic State terrorist group."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification shed new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensible with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who are trying to take him during an eventful phase of protection, in the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump pulls back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the contrary to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump tries to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the final storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump, while attempting to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this issue again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already introduced sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he had a strong criticism, when he said that the Russians were to cheer Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained," Of course, I thought the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "according to the way the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe it's clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough, so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more estimating tone, as his demand values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a big advantage in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to excuse himself for his provocative pronouncements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companion to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps of prominent faiths, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's testimony, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown small organisation, he called them backslider, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of State, allowed ISIS to spread it aggressively in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in front of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of sliding on each of his words and being taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, pathetic "television experts who try to understand him and said," You cannot! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats more ridiculed Mr. Trumps than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Verb Cafe was a small café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="3">"of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front were ousted."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the business Soap Cherie, replacing the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes."</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people smoked it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter," I know, New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"but if New York is change, it is also re-invention."</seg>
<seg id="8">"a restored Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He began to work at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a customer offered him to provide funding for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and there are shrimps like capers and sautéed onions."</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural keys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café no longer serves beer because there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old clients were also besieged by Williamsburg's prices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even after moving to Greenpoint, she would take the road."</seg>
<seg id="27">"after closing the club, she gave a while to drink coffee, she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was clear to me that I was lying on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="29">"now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea at that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition."</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I got a quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">"today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese."</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he has no grudge that the soap business has taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for Verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will still deal with her offer," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he prepared to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee into the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café is expanding onto an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated at the ground when the café closed.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an ample meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delights of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" "Chop Souey" "acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA while brick was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which appears on Tuesday in Harper Publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, local snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick man, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter was hacked, the couple met for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, gingerbread and poppy bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaply that stretches out the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have placed itself in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table served in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"women's teams coached for male field work and it was served fresh baked patés for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways that the country has moved with it, not to be the cockaigne."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for Americans became a central, sharpened theme," Coe allied why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle was reconfident as" wonderful way of food leftovers, "fried Ziegelman noted, since cooks could hide improper ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixes were tried because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter, too."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at the midday," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"like never before or since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - such as the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" budgetary politicians "and the challenge to turn pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "a Square Meal" "is a feast of historical delicacies."</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cake-meal-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa Farmhauser's kitchen in his kitchen, he feeds like the billionest man of the world he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked Continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," "said Coe."</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and had a tux.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor asked him to postulate an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Ms. Roosevelt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforted."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded as soon as the country came back to the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in writing the book, the couple had better understood the eating habits of the mother-in-law mother-in-law - for example, how they could not throw food away."</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of food waste," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ziegelman remembered," They actually made people sick. "</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the protection of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">"after the dishes were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and coe brought out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plant dessert, which President Roosevelt ate at noon."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it will be called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, and added that it was a nasty trick, modest recipes to miss a chic name. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"there were no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>
<seg id="51">"everybody dipped somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tough, brown glibber."</seg>
<seg id="52">"surprisingly, it did not taste bad."</seg>
<seg id="53">CoE repeated three times a supplement.</seg>
<seg id="54">"like a Can-Do-Budgetierer he said to his wife," A few chopped walnuts would help. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's haie mostly comes to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönland haie only got offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meters long animal accelerates at a total of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by loneliness, seems to be a bullet for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Grönlandhai who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock this life span which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Grönland haie become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea from the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the 6 degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time pentine measured her when she took six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrolling on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers that torch out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-haie who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lentil nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins they contain will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks conspicuously had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons seeking greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, with 220 cm length of third smallest animal, the lens nucleus contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons attempt, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in contrast, all larger Greenland-haie had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Grönland shark, while the record shark might be even 392 years old at 502 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Grönland haie with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methadalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was captured in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal losing heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on getting as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The demonstrators from the sea-care unit Eyneal-Haigerloch St. Anna went on a four-day pilgrimage tour from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were met."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time up to the next Romance trip of all the demonstrators in two years, the Upper Interministrant Committee of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage tour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimages were examined and decided finally for the Bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the people of Heiligenstadt."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and told the pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster Our Lady stands and so the Pilgrimage was taken from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches always rushed to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song book."</seg>
<seg id="11">The parishes of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller contributed to the stage targets for a tasty and stronger dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after this, one stepped out of the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of road, at first had to drop some 500 altitudes away and be heard again afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the doors of mercy."</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster the minis welcomed at the pilgrimage destination by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar."</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the afternoon, we went by train to Horb."</seg>
<seg id="23">"at the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, who had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy himself."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after they took sixth place in March at the World Championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahrer Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an executor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement has produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw the potential in the Scots, which has now developed."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner competed in the qualification rounds an Olympic team, but in the standstill rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but Kenny brought the team to the front, and Skinner stopped."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, driving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and give me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up a Olympic team and the World Champion was defeated."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys site there was a hint that after a weak start he dropped off on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such a superior win, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said:" "it feels like the UK flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kennys, it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny, who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy alike.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Douell qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with representatives before the qualification when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding Women's Competition, continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong web team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there were drama in the background, such as the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sex and bingo buns, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting shop of Portland due to the abolition of energy demand</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminum mould of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminate the energy supply contract, and thus all delivery contracts will be lifted, as the supplying energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is scheduled to run in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominoes, as the smelting consumes about 10 percent of the total power generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which last year led to a closing of the Anglesea power station."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting shop of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting shop with his Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the Treaties should be so-called" "hedging transactions", "which will come into force since November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point, AGL expects the treaties to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 is currently limited by predicting the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in the" "expectation of a termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to reserve the contracts, the" Skill of Alcoas... to run the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the smelting "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it ended 2010 a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into force from November this year even though it is not yet guilty of why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warned of the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Smith Mikkelsen said that Portland would consume about 600 megawatts each year and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set, that would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love brought me the view of this cover to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the cardashians similar?), screened reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this is the climatically heated story of nearly every birthday of a children's shipment (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to take her other girls to participate in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of cardashians has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim loves her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles an illustrated book as a fashion journal, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Brehionista were of the 832 pages of the grove 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of its cover stars is expected to seep in the last two years of the magazine before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women, who were already on the cover, include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, clearly more" celebrities, modeln "as" models, celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation, falls under the previous category, it is in good society."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had been publishing Lemonade for one of the most successful years of her career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality-TV-story Jenners's position in the fashion world was always something tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her "the mistings of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings just cooked high when the message came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lashing around on the mist seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="26">It works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"initially, the built-in memory was eight megabytes, which would range today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>

<seg id="7">She died still on site.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police, who asked them, and every witness of the incident, told them to report."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if Venus could have applied similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and yet progressed slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet presumably pointed to more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought about a history of Venus that resembles evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years, exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"when their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect returned -- Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star-pile rotate to different rates as well as in which connection the rotational periods with the planet formation stand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," "said Luisa Imull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware removal specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims pay readily the solvents required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackout software according to the observations made by Malwarebytes rather on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential for the ransom is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of the malware," "explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" World. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painters were still designed to send advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first, private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks resulted in a frightening fast in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works with a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case, people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure investigates the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to get more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they declare their sacrifices via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if individuals are redeemed by payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate a hard negotiation and pay five-digit sums in order to return their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively high-risk profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is likely that these are three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutant software then in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the up-to-date malware repair kits have been created by using malware, providing advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "says Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums underground, buying the set from a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals are in charge of spamming with spreading," "explains Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of the companies-IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey are proud to be able to repel Ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful acquisition, the perpetrator instead threatens the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies," explains Malwarebyte boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"according to the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Defcon event, safety researchers demonstrated how to get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening one walks around eternally, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the wake ring no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you are in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not recreative."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are various reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter weeb, member of the board of the German Society for Schlafforming and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"however, what one actually understands is the insomnia, so it is a sleeping and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people just feel asleep as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it, organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines can be stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is most common in depression," "says weeb."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, those who have a slipped disc can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly catches to salute all day problems and worries, shooting an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one become a doctor with insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week, should go to the doctor, take revenge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look very different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Dr. Ingo Fietze, director of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, stresses:"</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, you should first contact the primary doctor in case of sleep problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for examining in the sleep laboratory, medical doctors recommend snoring with respiratory replacers, in case of pathetic tiredness, in case of sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the paneling, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera draws on the ceiling to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"shooting counts: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch television to sleep, avoid alcohol and not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive at all."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a remnant of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police count them to the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a refreshing kindergarten and a beer shop."</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a gray house someone jumped "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">"opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new tenants will be built."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" "trendy district", "known as the respective real estate company Friedrichshain, is preferably illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented apartments, on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a strong police action against the project, the area referred to as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrol the police three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owners of the house."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers removed from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain worm late."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is attracting three children, is annoyed above all by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising miths and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from the vandaliatory left."</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and the police divide between house occupants and their neighbours does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in contrast to the rest of the city, Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers" district. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"Hausbesetzungen and the resulting living projects have long been part of the neighborhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire mainz street very close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was admitted to a regular street battle in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and ballers from all over the world over the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on the raised panes or freshly painted facades that were thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crime rates such as bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the largest part of the criminal offences constitute tangible damages, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house for 17 years beside the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to be."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will no longer exist in Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture she is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more apart than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously pulled into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"therefore it was so important for her to get back to her street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the Deutantenoheit across the borough."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through sighted new buildings in former buildings, which supplant the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are actually condominiums, which are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well infected," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you need to explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, don't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, problem cases exist, says customer frankly," "people with whom nothing goes." "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: are the two fear of radicalisation after the recent happenings, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine says quite clearly what some naive might call it. "a residual risk can and may not exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins brought them completely into obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine's client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So major and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants would soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the primitives are already busy to integrate the previous human beings in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
