Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
but it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution that is being discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington den@@ oun@@ ces Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election ahead of Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor he shot his girl@@ friend shot dead &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled onto a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Political ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 am .
he said that Lamb has made the cl@@ ums@@ y emergency call after it .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police arrived .
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lectur@@ ers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty contains 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb pra@@ b said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; previously , Lamb had asked Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner , meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not clear immediately why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 residents and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received a doc@@ torate in the spring of Ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play . &quot;
he was the gir@@ dle of women at that time .
&quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , 40 and living in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ joins a ba@@ the in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said she had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally devast@@ ated , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues played . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes convers@@ ational coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5th September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic@@ as@@ pi@@ el before a sp@@ her@@ ical audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
&quot; about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the University Choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Review E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect the police now says that Lamb killed the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products retail@@ er says he will give the current employee and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plan to stop 4@@ 0,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will begin this month with interviews and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies prepare to hire time processors to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and distribute products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a sim@@ ulated crow@@ ning and a length of arms from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest time travel film ever being shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be featured on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , on the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able .
&quot; B@@ an requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
surveys showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken it off as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now seeing t@@ umps capacity and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters want the Real Estate Mog@@ ul believe that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first random state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; yet 44 per cent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they set up their bew@@ il@@ der@@ ment , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C out of last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July turned their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everybody . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina he got 13 points lead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans said they have made their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have firmly for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago called &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; immigrants from Mexico , the immigration of the pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is far away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration is in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive apartment complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
&quot; in the street it costs a square meter of a floor house on average 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; it is said in the study - therefore , the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers one square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich is not really a little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the prices seems to be like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter .
&quot; OK , now I just want BF@@ 1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , Munich does not lie at the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy match from Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have brought a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; from the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ out in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
&quot; Müller was rewarded with his 28 hit in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s guidance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who allowed himself as a flan@@ k thought shot of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , among them against famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , here also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled across . &quot;
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts . &quot;
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on lef@@ th@@ and Douglas Costa that rarely happened against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown ble@@ w the head @-@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by direct pick up the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians were acc@@ ust@@ omed to their domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to rely on need@@ les . &quot;
but on the ke@@ epers of Manuel Neu@@ er he was ad@@ mitt@@ ance .
so about when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 54 . ) .
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , back to mus@@ cular problems in the cad@@ re , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Hero has only given green light after the final session , S &amp; D member Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an for the s@@ laugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Götz@@ e was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 74 . ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , Müller still sat on it . &quot;
before the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a small group of partly glo@@ bet@@ rot@@ ten Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went forward with kno@@ cks against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was viol@@ ated from the stadium .
anyone smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; those who smoke are not only har@@ ming the lungs , but also teeth - that places a long @-@ term study near Potsdam . &quot;
the good news : the risk of ren@@ unciation drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the Deutsches Institut for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3,6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists witnessed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes of tooth failure are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor stres@@ sing the authors . &quot;
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
smoking is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment again sin@@ king to the level of non @-@ smoking , Mr. Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people need to convince people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; explained the leader H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of lack of tooth@@ lessness disp@@ elled the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet on the banks of Cologne on the remains of late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum Skel@@ eton and remains of historic buildings have been excav@@ ated near the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a specialised office for archaeological excav@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; text documents have already been known , that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; besides remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman is killed at the railway station in bald Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman then crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by cap@@ turing the train , it has caused serious injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
it was treated in a medical manner and brought into a hospital by lif@@ egu@@ ards .
&quot; on the reason of the ni@@ ghtly crossing of the young woman , there is no evidence of the officers . &quot;
the incident has possibly been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ bä@@ cks@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;

European Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; to raise the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function is clearly more traditional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; stated the EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to launch the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is said to have created the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings clearly demonstrate that the EU states and the US have jointly selected independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
this is for the first time a second instance .
it would allow it to obj@@ ectively stand against verdi@@ ct .
&quot; so far , the proceedings involved in arbit@@ ration proce@@ eded among themselves , and there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work on an International Investment Court according to their own data . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , especially from major corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , through which the company is allowed to deny tax@@ pay@@ ers , to remove national laws or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act submitted the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; on the other hand , the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig@@ g ( SPD ) described the plans as great progress . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points in the reform of the Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU @-@ Commerce Ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporate association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the business &apos;s action by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , on Wednesday it remained un@@ clear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;

delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places he repeatedly shows on the map , about his min@@ utely and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they came and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be wonderfully creative . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great op@@ ul@@ ents at any time . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ather@@ ed series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be su@@ pers@@ eded . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .

&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the show . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; will be a nation@@ wide celebrated masterpiece in 2005 . &quot;
medit@@ ating on ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic links . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; far away from the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ brow@@ bands and big fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister is expected to be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited . &quot;
the new Prime Minister Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the premi@@ er of the Prime Minister and will join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will stand up to put the first of his six questions shortly after noon and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , held on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several fron@@ tier Stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he accepted the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of Shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top teams , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC , Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; Mr Smith said that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has since he has been a T@@ ory boss over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; S is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle who will be responsible for the shadow of economic governance if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad .
&quot; he also expressed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the Lower House to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kasper@@ le theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the premi@@ er of the Prime Minister . but a few years later , he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the verdi@@ ct of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among its members of parliament , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms . &quot;

pounds increased by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound ab@@ rup@@ tly rose to data that showed a rise in the growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the target SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and reco@@ ded ass@@ essments of the time of an increase in interest .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,5@@ 505 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after tak@@ eover bid of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were up 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures propose all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through stock sales , as part of his strategy of lowering debt . &quot;
&quot; the stocks of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; JD Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6,@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill states that a higher minimum wage for UK employees &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of the potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer extra jobs . &quot;

Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Leban@@ ese to Pot@@ ato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
&quot; it is both - in the m@@ ashed Pot@@ ato , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger idle owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sp@@ it sp@@ ends itself in his shop , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the Leban@@ ese had the idea to register in Munich at the patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes are in the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot;
Met@@ a starts ground @-@ to @-@ progress campaign to fight against ageing
Met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A branches from an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a contin@@ gency campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ a and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes rehear@@ s@@ als in IG@@ A stores and store owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian football le@@ ague to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ Life will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ alers for food , alcohol and devices carry out its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ a ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away from all existing stakeholders , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 $ millions of revenues per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and the amount of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million from interest and taxes , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ Life loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will decline sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week Le@@ ond@@ s@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ a would probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ a refused to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ a has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; the IG@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , hon@@ ors and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to enhance sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week , and IG@@ A retailers to improve their shops through fast growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a &apos;s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programmes are to be set to Elan , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; ISO @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spot@@ light with the in@@ famous confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gios and St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee twice , with Har@@ rison ex@@ claimed : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have hit Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a fight broke out a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I &apos;m rather i@@ fer is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the quar@@ rel , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he broke down a ra@@ cket when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken out of fru@@ stration himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take Kyr@@ gios on the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to enter the country illeg@@ ally . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations continued .
&quot; as a helicop@@ ter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants died &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ashed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ ing police . &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border , after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c , was unable to reconc@@ ile a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels . &quot;
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ l@@ ump@@ ed Italy and Greece . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes in a prompt action of Brussels or its neigh@@ bors . &quot;
the emergency situation issued on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country after having ended up a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ails were used in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that stands strong contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also specify higher sentence sentences for convic@@ ted tra@@ ffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen at the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already gone deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a trac@@ ing wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and press a crowd to go there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would be allowed to stay food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the preliminary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates but these proj@@ ections have decreased .
&quot; their support in the men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders just returned with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage for democratic voters less than 50 years has passed away , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pres@@ election nation@@ wide say they would be endor@@ sed by the Clinton party if they were nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some privileges , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
&quot; perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons , current supporters are enthusiastic about it , especially from her . &quot;
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the EU &apos;s democratic elec@@ tors say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidates , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also associated with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the sel@@ f@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the Vice President th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office into the balance , 57 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pres@@ election want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents of the preliminary elections will be asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clin@@ tons followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to nom@@ inate for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increasing against S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ er call questions about voters . &quot;
similar to the last month there is not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the preliminary elections as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results in some important characteristics of voters in the election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
Bi@@ den best cuts the three candidates with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic elec@@ tors do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 per cent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic constitu@@ ents have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; questions concerning H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs continues to be satisfied with their explanation of the matter , saying that it has not influenced their views altogether . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on her overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good grades at leadership . &quot;
&quot; among the six candidates we tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error quot@@ a for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on a nation@@ wide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; meanwhile , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others will lose momentum . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support grows of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes by Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Gover@@ nor of Florida J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in surveys - he lands with 19 % support from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising during the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side ho@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son had ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ umps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign session in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water . &quot;
a swim in the North or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people do not go into the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bie loaded
&quot; after a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , almost two years after a student union died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted , suppos@@ edly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and put the welfare of the Brotherhood on principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning of his injuries .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ lic@@ ted with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by the authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indictment for murder of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of religious attacks and the formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this has sanc@@ tioned , so we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch &apos;s College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest income comes , and the hou@@ ser@@ s will go down , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy is gli@@ ding into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first rise in interest rates and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the entire excitement might have been exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to be afraid . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a view based on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that net income is reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest rates . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has mostly been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest income , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average yield in recent six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average yield in recent six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the development cycle and the return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a interest increase of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the figures in Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and acc@@ entu@@ ate the question of &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the F@@ ed interest all year round , and all eyes focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all excav@@ ation cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates a interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ders seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the development cycle , the bond markets fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields from leng@@ thy and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , len@@ ding has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies operating the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond positively to three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with weak income after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will most lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar . &quot;
&quot; saver could see profits through higher revenue even though experts of different opinion are , how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham member of the board &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the sender for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itate The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliament and raises new pressure on the broadcast@@ er to prove that he does something that the private broadcast@@ ers do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conservative dep@@ uty , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards starting in December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will never learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work was to engage the audience as it did so in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory Euro MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy - George as Richter - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it comes to a series of entertainment next time . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee profiles for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales climb@@ ed slower in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the expenditure in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed 7 percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot;
&quot; he stated that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ ing , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as one reason for the decre@@ asing revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times exceeded the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers &apos; websites rus@@ hed off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that 5 £ spending was spent slightly more than 1 £ .
&quot; for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online , rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ eral scenes in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ dis Bin Laden group .
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 39@@ 4 people were injured , after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the people killed , as a crane rus@@ hed to Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession went over to the Holy Shr@@ ine where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king informed about the construction company of the Bin Laden because of the disaster , which also left 39@@ 4 , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 persons killed , when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central mo@@ cha Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead were Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was supported . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual ha@@ unt in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the business abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims face the H@@ add@@ est who later takes place this month . &quot;
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ opped the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger building projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ olic son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in 1990 @-@ 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is at least once required in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordained that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
others will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap eastern European crafts@@ man is over
&quot; British employ more and more craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ge behind
this means that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen are opened .
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales offices will close nation@@ wide . &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that Brit@@ ons lay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen , who carry out the work in their home . &quot;
&quot; if you can handle a hammer or a brush to brush walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; British employ more and more craftsmen to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their homes , such as the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , New Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ reinforced chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified arti@@ sans of Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 selling points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are taken by women .
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of items by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - variety is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the costs of closing the shops .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
officials of A@@ me / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the Landes@@ gericht Kla@@ gen@@ furt , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ vi@@ z@@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ osi@@ tions . &quot;
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this repro@@ ach , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds of association accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial crimes .
&quot; this fact was the president of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that no time had been an asset to the association . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials had only compens@@ ated for expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the passi@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we continue or block the club , &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the &quot; &quot; bread @-@ profession &quot; &quot; of the financial bure@@ au . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insurance as safety at the bank , &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial success , the payout of the expenses incurred has been decre@@ asing until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expenses suffered only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore l@@ ump and non @-@ detail recordings appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and par@@ ach@@ ments were jointly managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ end@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for the financial investments , it was important only to have the liberty of debt , such as the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
the def@@ endants declared that they were appropri@@ ations .
&quot; this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant , and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the respon@@ dent did not know a response . &quot;
&quot; after all , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage compensation . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
&quot; the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he would not agree with this wording , because the association has never been damaged by the association . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary also said that he never paid a cent salary , he only earned mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; at Di@@ ets , he charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants could not demonstrate exact documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept for a company audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
kilomet@@ re money was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; all accommodation can be done in cash , with which he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his residence , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard supplies another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the number of employees running for three years , the computer giant will continue to break down further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up . &quot;
the sub@@ missions on the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; this will reduce costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall down in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the current reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard share gains 2.3 percent .
&quot; the group of printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : this way , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a we@@ aker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 per cent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP replies with a split and massive sub@@ missions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted only late that customers buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and get more and more business online .
&quot; Whit@@ mans restructuring plans overall see the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : a majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers to combat operations in Iraq would largely be ref@@ using : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed themselves . &quot;
the fact that other states are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed , 20 percent would have been . &quot;
29 percent were unable to decide .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
&quot; the world is observed when the US bank@@ note comes together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time the interest has been raised for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ ey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a little longer , and the interest rates at the current level will hold 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate on zero .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less harsh outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets to stop an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday

&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted it to make it impossible , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he was shot at someone , and one killed someone . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; nobody will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police took the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note Lamb met 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb had suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter that is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &apos; absolutely best friends &apos; .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb have called relative to a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen hit him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb gained a doc@@ torate degree from Delta State University , as well as his way of life on the University &apos;s website . &quot;

&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; in addition , 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the goal of real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year resulting from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for passenger operations in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ flight lines should be developed as independently as possible .
managing director Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will in future be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the fare conflict with the pilot clean@@ up cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be res@@ umed after the court stopped on this Thursday . &quot;
this was divided by the union .
the subject of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; could result in viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilot , this is the savings concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it is fores@@ een that the Lufthansa is in the fight against competi@@ tor routes to the Group &apos;s own Euro@@ wings water@@ line .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this led to the left outside def@@ enders and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double bone structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operating in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantas@@ tically plays , and then this happens . &quot;
in the changing clothes he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an i@@ vory .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ ron@@ ged .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account answered : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V is suffering from this : Manchester United suff@@ ers from loss of Luke Sha@@ w
the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover until next June with the European Championship in France .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad with it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a throw from Chris sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the prime minister chose The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good except that the following paragraph describing the story of the book , in which Cameron is said to describe the story of the film version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ose @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , while he died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ose @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally presented and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for a child 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew but it is still difficult
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; the A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; based on this , Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ cludes from the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ players are geared to results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the course of Ly@@ th was extended , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopes for further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his post@@ ure , even though he did not get such a good performance , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test man gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only repro@@ ach one can raise was that England initially deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I hold high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scor@@ ed 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to cook mos@@ ques beside cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger , former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger , played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener . &quot;
he has made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in changing clothes , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar inter@@ mission against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team administrators do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants to see the UK looking outside in the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let &apos;s see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened with the exagger@@ ated long performers such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; hence , perhaps some such ministers even plan to deliberately not make any helpful comments , in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the crus@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press reviews in 1975 but did not support our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made himself a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone ham@@ mer@@ ing ali@@ ens and the p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als that most of our major newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bla@@ ir actually thought about it , but determined that if you sit in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa , you better spend ban@@ anas to dist@@ ra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which then opened it a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the BN@@ R 80 years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ se@@ ater left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ur tendency and the wil@@ der Gef@@ il@@ ds of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein Engl@@ ands can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television that week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their brief@@ ing on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding facility of par@@ an@@ oia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for granted , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past , is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ fest convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze report by Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , join Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which he explained his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims were based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also subscri@@ bed to the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports beforehand by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also include a sector financing on paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also attended the tobacco management of p@@ he .
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work is indic@@ ative that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; so far there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers were &quot; premature . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims had previously been re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers than tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by defining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for publicly @-@ legal programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller public , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broadcast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in channel 4 without success , to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would be clearly shown by non subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Supreme Military Committee under his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I would like to see how this is going to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts reflect what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson told the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think we all think you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC @-@ production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example on the public broadcast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , taking this in &apos; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with commercial sender &apos;s alli@@ ances to make it available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by break@@ down@@ s of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by turning Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asonic waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ genetics , used in ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure which releases electric impulses in the brain of people for treating symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultrasound but Chal@@ azi@@ ani realized they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when used ultr@@ asonic on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ lows and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , I was a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from easily nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ atter : people tell where you come from , from where and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ Year , where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask Questions and show interest .
&quot; it dist@@ ra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress and move their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the high point of back @-@ management , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they are saying to use themselves , even if they are bo@@ iling within . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , because there were three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted with even more lou@@ der music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neigh@@ bors to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour check . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move to the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be fundamentally embarrass@@ ed if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , ran@@ som to them , separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they bring together all common friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is more fine than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good one is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ern your pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Single @-@ Ad@@ ults , Stra@@ ight @-@ S@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds up in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental Town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need homes , but also the single mother and the poor man . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
that is different when you put people into bar@@ racks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without grounds . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building rules complicated their plans ?
guil@@ d : I have broken my project correctly .
&quot; in particular , it always makes the im@@ pending d@@ amo@@ kl@@ ess @-@ value special construction and the Stell@@ ar Ord@@ in@@ ance . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but they were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor man . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today .
that &apos;s why it works .

&quot; it may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so by backing up the updates , and it will be easier if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating , or located near a charger so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off on half way and this could lead to a demoli@@ tion of the update . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the carrier of the Cross Cross 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which Chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
&quot; thus it is possible to record chess players , who cannot accommodate the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wants the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is searching for direct contact
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; Alten@@ Centre Anton@@ ist &quot; &quot; have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened up a new place at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; directly next to the market , sen@@ iors and couns@@ ell@@ ors receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health care insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for many years now , we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; also , many services of the insurance companies are not often used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the citizen &apos;s hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the Seni@@ or@@ centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
for this a good de@@ centralized infrastructure is indispensable in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) in the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular soci@@ able presence . &quot;
&quot; with this , the social foundation supports a large contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 am . &quot;

&quot; the police search for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now cried to the young man and hit him on the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al bite and ble@@ eds strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends had ha@@ st@@ ened and weigh@@ ed down on the ra@@ cket , he was first deter@@ red by his sacrifice . &quot;

the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to the apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ rup@@ ts .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller succe@@ eds in the field in the field on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; when Ur@@ sel Klin@@ gh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the career began years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met , who currently completed her specialty training in the gil@@ ded hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ph@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees himself as his own boss . &quot;
and so they agreed that the gar@@ bage bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies at Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 he was appointed chief doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is volunte@@ ered in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice is being prepared for the new boss . &quot;
his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology while the surgeon works as a primary doctor .
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as pets . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the renovation the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ performance EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage will receive a grant from a total of 50,000 euros as part of a supporting programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; says Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks . &quot;
there is another medical practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Klin@@ gh@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor has found itself , it would have also gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , by the way continues to look primarily in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the fields of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the medi@@ cs practi@@ sed there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Klin@@ gh@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot;
she already felt a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
her husband added laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; until now I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; however , it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also travel to Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
firm of the Year for Pat@@ ents d@@ f @-@ mp Dör@@ ries Frank @-@ Mol@@ nia &amp; P@@ ohl@@ mann Firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly monitored as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ in wants to make its borders for refugees but not abri@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees have already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with some 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Serbian border , which hi@@ therto had mig@@ rated to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted by Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was that they were wise to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; was it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus arrived with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should travel here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could now actually lead to a postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister East o@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in Schengen .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since then consistently report a good report on the standards of border controls . &quot;
on Serbian side there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm at a local ophthal@@ m@@ ologist in Hor@@ gos on Wednesday : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed . &quot;
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
refugees advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distribut@@ ing maps for refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still un@@ cleared mine fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region . &quot;
Bör@@ sen @-@ Hack@@ er : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were brought to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be tra@@ pped &quot; , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with stunning autumn sunshine and four big tables in each case with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively drew attention to her 20th anniversary and sees himself confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions , as well as the volunteers . &quot;
&quot; while man@@ ch interven@@ es spont@@ aneously to chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the sentence to &quot; &quot; be@@ j@@ ah@@ en my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer for long &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , there are little discussion about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that at some point is the end of this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ itas Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to speak publicly on the tablets is understandable , finally it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and dying is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people . &quot;

&quot; confronted with a personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking volunteers , she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ fare , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the mort@@ al and fun@@ eral companions .
training for new employees will be offered every two years .

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the supply giant sen@@ sed his outlook for a whole year because of the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wishes to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. announces to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cent less than previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; anal@@ ysts predicted , according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 . &quot;
&quot; the lower prospect is despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher surcharge for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless hoped that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and because of growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid income &quot; when considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS , which plans to stop 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts predicted . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks surv@@ ey@@ ed anal@@ ysts expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; over the past few years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority ship@@ ments , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , bo@@ d@@ transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , sank the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;

&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incen@@ tive by the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already careful F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to increase this volati@@ lity through raising interest rates for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are ob@@ serving , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what sec@@ ures itself in the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently surv@@ ey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest increase this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect an a@@ waiting the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts alle@@ vi@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value was around 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed politics maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in explaining the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would so@@ ot@@ he financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow deep@@ ening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary to raise the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to levels which the F@@ ed considers as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and need it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world collap@@ sed last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would crum@@ ble global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , with the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the H@@ och of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when you should raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would raise the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ an , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA C@@ innamon Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
&quot; now , he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effect better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the technical decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , dissolved conf@@ usions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they will not only super@@ vise the developments elsewhere , but also advis@@ ing with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; co@@ ater , right member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a interest in interest , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impacts on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ ier said . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest in interest . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she fears for an increase of interest , because markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think it should advance the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is commonly referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes more than an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole purchasing makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s and has various tak@@ eover options .
what is there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even fry on demand for you . &quot;
&quot; here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ al , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef and g@@ all , spon@@ ge @-@ natural dar@@ m , fish balls , regional saus@@ ages , commerci@@ ally prepared food and more . &quot;

the wide pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh mon@@ th@@ ong dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles at the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even though the shop is well attended , it is not hard to find a parking place . &quot;
Nag@@ y@@ ti@@ la@@ j : lovely cottage at the edge of the village
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er at Dill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different than at the right school . &quot;
Brazilian pap@@ al society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al organisation Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women in shock@@ ing fashion how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research indicates that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative impact on the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym@@ nas@@ tics building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent Community meeting , the completed construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to this , the committee approved an application for an &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid Local Development Plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ cent@@ ered first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this enables us to create a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; it was again about the slope that is required for energy reasons - different than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan was not permitted to &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; with regard to the slope - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally passes restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tion applications . &quot;
&quot; however , in gym@@ nas@@ tics construction , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
supplements are expected from school and mass sports promotion .
&quot; in the next processing step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Federal Council for Ex@@ am@@ ination . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ tsch@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital Pei@@ sen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the employees move from Pei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital Group of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this should be made by the Supervisory Board and conven@@ es the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , the employees who do not have to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change was initiated by Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered the game , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1st and change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means in every case an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the interior station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
&quot; for the next two years , fisher@@ man will be able to join his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ en@@ schaft , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ tsch@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; Mr J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I exclude that . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ care regim@@ ent .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; said Fischer via the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; positive and very comprehen@@ sible &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as chief doctor for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the mobil@@ es of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) at the Malt@@ ese HC .
&quot; the stand@@ still leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for the arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the bath@@ ers made a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and made a difference there . &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ fall with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest in the afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the ab@@ err@@ ation on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Witt@@ enberg near Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in operation , as the police announced . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident was first un@@ clear .

&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and threw their cor@@ p@@ ses into a channel in rock enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate , who had been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate , has fallen victim to violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern on Tuesday evening , as prosec@@ utor and police wed@@ ded on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old det@@ ain@@ ted on Tuesday evening , who actually stated the indication , and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning , after she had not come home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old revealed . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
&quot; the det@@ ain@@ ees were reported to the authorities in the police inter@@ ro@@ gation , killing the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the channel . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable p@@ encils .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Alliance &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ order accommodation . &quot;
many then drive onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to rising refugee numbers . &quot;
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany inv@@ ests a housing defic@@ it , which will grow from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore stayed in large cities with not@@ ations in shared rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama due to the roy@@ alties on the housing market .
&quot; in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incen@@ tives are to boost the social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; thus , the tax rate tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an attractive tax depreci@@ ation is necessary according to the alliance . &quot;
the programme for refugee camps by the State Bank Kf@@ W is now well established in towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia establish cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no more transit , as more and more refugees choose to travel across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is nevertheless dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia by establishing a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene Minister of Internal Affairs , and if necessary , we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria , and is already part of the Schengen zone . &quot;
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the off @-@ off of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , have also practically superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to most media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
&quot; in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not margin@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the border strip holds other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , there are little more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 366 .
&quot; shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday , there were still 93@@ 80 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws viol@@ ate the over@@ coming and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ uns as a criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the convic@@ ted threatened prison sentences of up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established transit zones , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people are . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees left there . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a view to get asylum granted in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
lock@@ ers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the bor@@ der@@ site was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government data . &quot;
in Salzburg there are about 1400 people waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , small groups of refugees met on foot . &quot;
Mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge on Sunday we were busy with clearing up when suddenly ten people were standing at the door of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany on Sunday had surprisingly set up rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the borders along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before that , we had the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we have said that we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take her to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the tow@@ ed passengers were switched to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening in Wels in a regional train , so that the rail traffic was shut down to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot;
but the regional train was stopped in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Br@@ ücken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ bridge race sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
&quot; instead of assi@@ sting in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately upon the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially moved the position of the Hungarian government into the world of national socialism . &quot;
cor@@ nerst@@ ones of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; even the refugees will find that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; that they have been invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter@@ ly quar@@ ter@@ ings &quot;
&quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands . &quot;
Christian Konrad is acc@@ ust@@ omed to his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place neighbour@@ hoods for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no more hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great tur@@ mo@@ il , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ stroke . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a total of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ary year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide more than 15,000 of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can manage it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the provincial governor , he has already held talks . &quot;
they would have assured him to create lod@@ gings even for the next refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ atar supports Konrad .
there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning and will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also sets high expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels which are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in periods of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ gings have to hold a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the tor@@ so . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , Konrad gro@@ unded with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not speak in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic to cost , as they explained themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
&quot; up to now , his own quest for lod@@ gings was not yet successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better distribution
there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the suff@@ erers are currently under control without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their su@@ itability . &quot;
the principal officer is critic@@ ising the allocation of refugees inside the federal state .
also other districts must make their contribution .
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday ac@@ counted for further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further entry of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for more reinforced solidarity in refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New ship@@ yard and later also to re @-@ compete .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market arcade : finally , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business calendar . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; but I wonder@@ ed if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has taken Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , cannot answer the experts with the last security . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s up to the fact that a beautiful bag evalu@@ ates every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump have come from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ am@@ ers .
&quot; this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it is alien@@ ating from a foreign enemy , journalists are concerned or gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office p@@ onder@@ s the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
this is also recorded in the Palat@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ ehn @-@ hair@@ style is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant @-@ town is related to him over -@@ zig corners with him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ stadt repor@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native town of K@@ all@@ stadt has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , which besides Tr@@ ump is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
to the king of the hearts he did not bring &#91; it &#93; there .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to think that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - exc@@ essi@@ vely High German : the makers , she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the l@@ ender . &quot;
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the Real Estate Group were the first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Palat@@ inate belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Palat@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film launch . &quot;
dump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contra@@ sts with the sometimes striking statements of the desc@@ end@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall in order to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ed , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was born of Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ Host@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ Places , that a desc@@ end@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the choice , because &quot; he has such radical beliefs , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had sa@@ wing in the USA at the time of his grandfather were like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ ograph@@ ers , even in the USA arous@@ ed interest . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavarian village Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ residents village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages . &quot;
&quot; in neighboring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a reserve .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rus@@ hed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast@@ ed by the capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a series of international television broad@@ casts in London , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators since sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months .
&quot; in August Today , Today was 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September Sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers stood at 3@@ 14,@@ 000 on Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change relate this morning to more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are al@@ right , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ pt father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers , and struck easily The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e flow@@ ed on an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scor@@ ed 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour Sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ seat at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seat will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute that couldn &apos;t win the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly appear who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
the woman who finally ends with Sam Wood in The Bachelor was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the remaining girls left will certainly not give up if she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three , you may acci@@ dentally be given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have acted in a ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby recognized his sense of humor , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a game spo@@ iler , who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly recognised both - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and realised ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought this throughout the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; she added Mar@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; the One &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree will be broadcast on Wednesday , 7 : 30pm . &quot;
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne selected the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a tur@@ f as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt @-@ return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding off his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the play field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 when a pass was in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools prior to collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;

&quot; of course , A@@ sy@@ l will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger requested the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; as a result , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; FW @-@ leader &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is pushing , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more man@@ age@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in Groß@@ glo@@ om should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ term tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , cult minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; ( CS@@ U ) to 47 gram@@ mar schools , where an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ um intermediate level was tested from three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger does not go far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the Chief of the FW . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want this .
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; he said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of them casting stones and bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before returning to rubber shells .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the type of rubber used by which is known is that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus , who want their own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been violent conflicts since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been ruled by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution was on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted on certain cl@@ auses this week in the constitutional design in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the planning of the holiday village at the little sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several lawyers are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure fu@@ gi@@ um .
&quot; months behind closed doors were negoti@@ ated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday village near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; system construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the neighbourhood of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which def@@ ended the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends from System Building Management went to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; however , it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now . &quot;
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
&quot; conv@@ ul@@ sions under Meer@@ bus@@ ch @-@ owners , who had come to the meeting , sh@@ ou@@ ted the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of Meer@@ bus@@ ch and member of the Board of Inter@@ esting the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; there must be full bus loads , so that it pays off , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what happens exactly on the well a h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches campaign sponsor@@ ship campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ db@@ . O ) announced a campaign that will raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations because they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of giving a manager the announcement , Rita Ma@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip includes many dark train and bus routes , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / refuge@@ er@@ el@@ ief will be doubled to 11 million $ .

di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are fat@@ ally obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , which have been collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c hos@@ pi@@ ce - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 .
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease loos@@ ened completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes complete only by one percent and in some cases , with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in the BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people subjected to an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have stuck their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is currently attrac@@ ting attention at the moment : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting mainly for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader asked to stop violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford dedicated to Eth@@ ics Studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attack of 11 September and revealed that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase of hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; toxic control centers in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , swal@@ lowing a strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , thus the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of recei@@ pts from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 reported toxic@@ ity control centers , from 3,@@ 266 to 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to be in emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teen@@ agers have suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing m@@ outh@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand sani@@ ti@@ zer ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; particularly in small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four squ@@ ir@@ ts of after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant hand sani@@ ti@@ zer at school , was brought to an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally required by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah rang out her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors were watching them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and hit his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants out of the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to po@@ ison her &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; she says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and t@@ amed them out of their space .
the police considered the ver@@ ei@@ ving plan as &quot; p@@ onder@@ ous &quot; and referred to the school authority in disciplinary action .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing talk about dis@@ cord
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was spont@@ aneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates do not stand under increased control as they prepare for the confron@@ tation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish Football is bor@@ ed by Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic @-@ games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
you can find out about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ings to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stands with five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .

why I will be a witness of an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the killer chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January through his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emoti@@ onally .
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a charged me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have been able to form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series pod@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ er of action .
but I believe a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

&quot; in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him off and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he went to the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ pers trial at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ handed grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think I &apos;m doing my best for them .
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer anymore . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before that , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y its stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should definitely touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to sei@@ ze me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I think it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave very cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have been built with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ folded master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse deb@@ ts , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my associates has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been so yesterday all day , which was so . &quot;
but it had been so on the racing day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the racing day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver &apos;s cur@@ sed arrested
the police arrested a man after a colli@@ sion with a cycli@@ st and a rider cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram on the weekend .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicop@@ ter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley @-@ highway .
the police said that the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from Nath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged for driver cur@@ sed and lowered assistance and other traffic deli@@ ghts .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals for claims of ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favourites of N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires would have allowed the storm players &quot; Ring battle &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team scor@@ ed the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in struggle .
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the fli@@ ck@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she was focusing only on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; well , Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team would be confident because it felt that they were worried to be struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s always up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or the techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kling a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not acc@@ ust@@ omed to losing it so it was a bit a shock to him .
it &apos;s funny how this happens again and again during this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a failure .
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
&quot; well , Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roo@@ sters scor@@ ed a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are Pau@@ sen making and no points a little exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet them . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday night in advance at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
send with G@@ mail
&quot; a man who may have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get to the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and transferred to Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless background . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Mr Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be sufficient to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , daily reports to the police and stays at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house tears apart
&quot; in the event of a colli@@ sion with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three participating trucks had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried to ev@@ ade in vain , at the last moment , to the left , as the police announced . &quot;
the cab driver &apos;s cab is completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to cur@@ l pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es for sending pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through and found the bew@@ il@@ dering messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor of E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have imp@@ uted illegal pictures of children on 14 June this year , and not to court hear@@ ings on March 24 of this year . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate attorney Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; can be found in his transgres@@ sion . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael closed the sentence until October to get background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in cust@@ ody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was recorded before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; ISO @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) &quot;
many hau@@ lers were driven out of fear of discovery and arrest by people on smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and for@@ wards to the German side .
there they are received from Bundes@@ police and forwar@@ ded to the registration .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; there were around 700 people in the state capital alone until 8@@ am , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : runner of Tro@@ pical Storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm @-@ fires in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , divided into the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the deep Deep was the ancest@@ or of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic in the past days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , it is still in the Black Forest in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ seek@@ reis with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun is shining again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly movement among the compact cars which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ str@@ ations fell to this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
Opel Astra is one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German high@@ ways .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost 16 990 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be the new compact car next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he also comes as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan im@@ plant wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also Suzuki Bal@@ eno which will celebrate its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is measured according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n designer cast a hand at the front section : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of kno@@ bs reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel Pen@@ al Stat@@ ute , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the infrin@@ gement of their dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
the suff@@ erers may even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was physically un@@ divided . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s information , was now on a free foot , was moved into a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court took up the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to it again . &quot;
they see man &apos;s dignity seriously injured .
the Court of Appe@@ al now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention days are decisive for compensation , whether a compensation claim was given , it was called . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; fear of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; in April , they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was naked in a prison cell . &quot;
&quot; un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the re@@ occupation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was placed between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to head@@ lines because of lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fight @-@ fights it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we manage &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it .
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments every year - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space , however , is dramatically due to affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing costs exp@@ ire from the rental price and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to occur per year , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , scientists and Federal Minister of Building agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically after their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognize labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residents to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the shortage of skilled labour , there has also been a majority in the view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; up to now , there is not yet sufficient offer of general and job @-@ oriented language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore based on the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg on the integration of labour .
&quot; the Berlin school administration stated that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ uted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eln@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management sells manual leaf@@ lets in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German are prepared for classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by skilled teachers , but also teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimate that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception to this date was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence or debt have no benefits after the asylum seek@@ er law act , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter basically don &apos;t get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate people . &quot;
&quot; pati@@ ently refugees had to live four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shor@@ tened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demanded Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims and for many people religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually conc@@ ede the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church law to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization , who car@@ es professionally for the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
the rights also belong to duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes a willingness to take preced@@ ence against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to discharge such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will have to change the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general equality law since a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif in the police and authorities .
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders have long been calling for and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention Germany undertake , must come true in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are supposed to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the previously expected refugees , Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we manage that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands that all newcom@@ ers have to settle in the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be settled by federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cast as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ ers act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are doing the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are poor@@ ly informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpre@@ ting costs should not only be accepted in hospitals , but also in medical practices . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already helped with more general medical treatment centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic perspective .
&quot; in the case of refugee children , for instance , there are much more un@@ restricted disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; however , with some of the other diseases German doctors came from her training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite diarr@@ ho@@ ea or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to the Federal Patent Psych@@ otherap@@ ist League ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from among other things the so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart r@@ att@@ ling and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong shock and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees have received psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; psych@@ ically ill seek@@ ers in the social offices can submit a motion for psych@@ otherapy , but usually the treatment lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
arena invites you to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you in the Man@@ ege on the brick wall to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Animal teacher and junior boss . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current almond production .
&quot; for more than 33 years , cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift to am@@ a@@ ze lies in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their everyday lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .

&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intui@@ tion and jo@@ in@@ ence . &quot;

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic with different animal welfare organizations . &quot;
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst takes a position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals it is not good . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , can be read from the eyes upon the possibility of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
the first commandment is good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17th to 20th September daily at 5@@ pm and 8@@ pm .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 am and 4 pm .

Sim@@ ple@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , African oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ g@@ ations of opposition members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
&quot; in the past month , they had hidden it and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; she war@@ ns the members of the Parliament that the imm@@ unity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave the parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief spokes@@ man said that the Party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; on the dangers to politicians .
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 @-@ 30,000 work@@ places within the framework of re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and its service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected reduction in job cuts leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses helping businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will focus on delivering so far un@@ successful , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s declaration . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates from Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP passed a massive restructuring in order to master the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta states that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand against the game against the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
&quot; in contrast to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , Wen@@ ger stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer on the European Championship is still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 League players in the last five playing times .
the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a pr@@ one period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career off the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al will start its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spots next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with Ki@@ er@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to give a brief pause , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s favourites are to go ahead by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched during the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , which was measured at Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from the far hope to lead the club to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more desper@@ ate than ever has become , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it is three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , aiming to ask the men to seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally @-@ healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship may work .
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , vibrant and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psychologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments playing football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can refer to it often , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of telephone past@@ oral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; my role of listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and compl@@ acent , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I come with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much as my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you attend this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ party with the completely rev@@ amped scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know the difference to make your friendship possible .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ di Cav@@ ani according to his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , Maria meets PS@@ G to pass Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ di Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; with less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the road , she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scor@@ ed a head ball@@ ad in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only aiming for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a class play by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs . he was later replaced by his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illu@@ stri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not scor@@ ed one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which on the weekend was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ wing was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the nest . &quot;
&quot; however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off , hit the field at An@@ pi@@ ff , with nine national players on the field and was a serious competi@@ tor with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead PS@@ G himself sometimes appeared on , with some mis@@ si@@ les and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in the first half of the time and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ers into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shot , which was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth seasonal factor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have played only in the Swedish League that did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fier games are not enough . &quot;
hat@@ s off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola hin@@ dered 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously , the FC Bayern was just ahead of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;
&quot; eight times of Spanish champion , three times championship champion , four time Champions League winner , twice champion@@ ships champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ avi was not changed
the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this now works for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great European Championship .
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he won me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the red off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not required behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protag@@ onist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ais brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
De@@ ar White People &apos;s producer argued for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was aired , social media explo@@ ded prior to dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter &apos;s Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO WHITE it hur@@ ts . &quot;

&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement insi@@ sted on the nation@@ wide effect and urged governments and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured nec@@ essi@@ ties . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a recording to the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums have still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hatred . &quot;
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; on the last task , climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the gain of the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge over it .
he is just as happy to have what he has done .
he received numerous awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warrior was extended for a season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers loops in Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once upon a time , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins wast@@ ed a chance to climb within a half @-@ half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American le@@ ague game card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories play fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Go@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit spot@@ ted three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of any game and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game .
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first race since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he sw@@ ung the be@@ ech@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said the algorithm . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked clearly better off the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh inner ring , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton donated the inning with a double to the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a st@@ unt and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped a Two @-@ Run to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run at the second , Ver@@ hagen got the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27 times leading in the Major League in this season that plat@@ ou@@ ffe had a double play
&quot; when Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , a R@@ BI doubled against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ Don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth . &quot;
Detroit acted as a pr@@ el@@ ude to the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scor@@ ed three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted by the vulner@@ ability before the game , having been missing for more than one month because of a spinal cord . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter first , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the runners in scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers laid in the second one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not very well beaten , but he has caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scor@@ ed no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ h@@ ander A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes . &quot;
note : tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the throwing shoulder .
he is being studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder release , is to be activated for launching on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing in the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and Tw@@ ins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin san@@ gu@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees should perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was awa@@ ited for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in charge will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden , on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ ess@@ isches Landes@@ hauptstadt had been prepared for this eventu@@ ality in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily supp@@ ress .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , according to the pres@@ idency of the pres@@ idency of the government , G@@ ießen took 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency accommodations in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
I@@ sc@@ opes : German military measures in Syria
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states &quot; collective driving . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was glad that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict cra@@ cks in front of our front door , &quot; he said at Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive boost of international aid on site for the refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria has also rein@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed controls in its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , no refugees returned to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the general manager for public safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees passed through the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ er route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , proposed a special summit for next week . &quot;
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to a binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , Angela announced on the late Tuesday night after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , protect him too . &quot;
those who do not have good areas of responsibility cannot stay in Germany either .
this view was divided in@@ vigor@@ ously in the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck on the can@@ als route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to seal the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is unlike Serbia as part of the EU .
&quot; Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ gling routes across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants arrived on the road to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the C@@ anz@@ er of Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean s@@ wore .
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; thus , the moon rises slightly on its path around the ring @-@ planets . &quot;
&quot; this motion of exchange is only small , but nevertheless too large for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ic@@ ul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , spl@@ itting water vap@@ or and iron particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least on the south pole there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
but the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
the 1860 Munich must abst@@ ain from offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama for a month .
an examination made an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old divided the association .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama was compl@@ aining about pain . &quot;
according to Munich Leo the diagnosis &quot; pres@@ um@@ ably means four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a non @-@ un@@ matched pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ en@@ siv@@ ity . &quot;
the 30 year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot;
Tor@@ h@@ unter Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player will get into running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a fierce colli@@ sion on his head .
&quot; despite his first fears , he remained without a serious bladder . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ go contain plenty of sugar
Mang@@ oes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy : in them , B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. First of all contain man@@ gan@@ ese , but a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor ß @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly cra@@ w@@ l . &quot;
the shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
there are also sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , p@@ oultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; for the Christmas market in the US , the US par@@ cel service UPS supplies up to 95@@ 000 hospitals . &quot;
&quot; the company already started recru@@ itment of seasonal workers , distributed UPS on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , ups had increased its workforce by 95@@ ,000 copies for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries submitted to the par@@ cel service har@@ sh@@ ly criticism . &quot;
&quot; first con@@ cili@@ ary storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the valleys of the alpine mountain side of the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and at night on Thursday the fo@@ ehn partially b@@ lows with storm @-@ strength by the fo@@ ehn weather .
&quot; after the con@@ cili@@ atory on Thursday morning , a prominent cold @-@ front crosses us , which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind arches and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
on the north@@ side of the Alps it opens up to the wed@@ n@@ esday by the valleys .
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n flo@@ ats in the fo@@ ehn valleys with slopes from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ ehn valleys with slopes of 60 to 100 km / h , partly with over 100 km / h especially in the Ur@@ i land . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate up to the adjacent middle @-@ country , and on the mountains even or@@ can bo@@ ars of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair stands for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the bottom of the Alps . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , some excess of 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air emerg@@ es , as a result a cold @-@ front rolls with a strong , partly per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold @-@ front , the wind pi@@ cks up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures rise significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther site in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park was christ@@ ened on the O@@ pp@@ io hill on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
he is now known as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret societies for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
&quot; Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) , as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , held a few months in Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 . &quot;
he received the city then as a de@@ ple@@ xed sin@@ ner be@@ ak .
his negative impressions wanted him to be reinforced by histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his th@@ eses against the dec@@ eiver .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many theme areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective scrip@@ tures based on painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpre@@ ts the scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into &quot; &quot; today , into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; it is embedded between the original biblical text of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his own personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Order . &quot;
&quot; since the education came up with the cane @-@ stock , &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ work it , and perhaps to bring me back with the Father &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to restore art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is now dominated by advertisement , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to fall into the images , let them work , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not take care of cap@@ turing the Bible completely , but also selected the most important , also mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; it was a picture @-@ bi@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the original - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; plans made , place found , companies commissioned , model@@ ed Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a round trip : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was finished . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ures in politics and administration caused ver@@ ge , especially among residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
the approval will be given in October and the first joint venture Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; I hope this year is even more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further mem@@ orials &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga assumes a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
football respon@@ ds to the prevailing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics its help in cop@@ ing with the pending problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the Chancellor &apos;s Office next Wednesday and meet the Minister for State , Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out has to put policy .
the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee Initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 prof@@ essors are putting a clear sign if they will be carried on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor @-@ logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens &apos;s sports leader Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee tragedy goes to everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we are able to use football feder@@ ates , no , we have to use our brilli@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was speaking of a prominent representative of the le@@ ague .
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a great community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;

reports : chief Executive Officer lost an eye in case of accident
&quot; the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a down@@ fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the US , he fell on a water glass , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ mis@@ hed , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen in such a way . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you have fallen down . &quot;

&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken down . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training session on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk position at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the goal of the door .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of chief keeper Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European le@@ ague games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left it open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;

Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of industry at the IAA . &quot;
the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transport emphasized among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction and a fast pace on digital radio communication .
for the testing of new technology there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to examine the legal framework , and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that hi@@ therto only sees people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when driving automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ve@@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the driver assistance systems sector and the highly automated driving functions at the German location in 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l &apos;s SPD traffic officer . &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey carried out on Wednesday at the AA in For@@ sa , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be en@@ forced in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe 31 per cent at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed by 2025 will reck@@ on with self @-@ prop@@ elled cars in the US 33 percent . &quot;
drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle anyway .
&quot; after a survey conducted by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give the control over all the roads throughout the road . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still imagine 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ co Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .

&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier is too old for an En@@ f@@ ant Command
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I was the En@@ f@@ ant Command of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial stance at a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if one dies , one gets to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ die . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without having ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was carried out : to mill the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the Cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tonnes of material have been m@@ apped to Munich according to the Cur@@ ators . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ gy fashionable foot@@ steps of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to him .
he then taught the design of fashion himself later .
he rolled in fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
&quot; before we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en , to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , which , for example , processed them on blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ des P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ dry point , fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , an increasing order potential . &quot;
who does not operate any niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us they already carry half of all orders .
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ des P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken off . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; also weak@@ est export , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt comple@@ ments : &quot; this refers to the materials used .
diploma @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outside of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to resist the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the firms that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only slightly varies to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was re@@ covering the historical snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small spheres in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ ma@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; previously , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot;
now she uses the Schne@@ eb@@ all@@ spitze for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region relate to the topic of P@@ lau@@ en Peak - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a souven@@ ir piece . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en Peak .
Disney plan new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a re@@ petition , but a kind of continuation who plays the magic n@@ anny for 20 years after the first film . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the global economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays p@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .

XI suggests opening the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy has to open to the outside to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group entrusted with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promoting public enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , the sectors and companies identified which are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a major role in allocation of resources , ensuring a legal business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen up controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financi@@ ers and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ mar@@ ginal value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , and to render consumers a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper in the EU , shar@@ ply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of inf@@ ested industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one kil@@ ogram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have already been bur@@ dened so strongly with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; however , Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned peak values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de dist@@ ra@@ ction man@@ eu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans which strongly accum@@ ulates over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small quantities can especially cause damage to the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury gets primarily through coal combustion into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants exp@@ elled more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings against mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
