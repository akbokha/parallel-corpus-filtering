&quot; concentration of the follow @-@ up procedure on the phases of the fuel cycle , which could be produced by the production , processing , use and storage of core material , from which without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear br@@ amm@@ ers could be manufactured , and the greatest possible limitation of the follow @-@ up procedure with other core material , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To effectively carry out the safety measures in accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention grants information on core material , the safety measures are subject to and on the characteristics of the facilities necessary for the implementation of the safety measures concerning this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of their tasks under the Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on plants shall be limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the use of securing measures in relation to core material , which is subject to the safety measures pursuant to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) To request the Community , the organization is prepared to examine investment data , which considers the community to be particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not require the organization to become obsol@@ ete , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organisation in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization reco@@ vers the approval of the Community and States to the nam@@ ing of insp@@ ectors for the states .
&quot; II ) Gener@@ ate the community either against a proposed nom@@ ination or at any time against an appointed denom@@ ination , so the organisation of the Community and the States suggests one or more alternate names . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the re@@ peti@@ tive refusal of the community to appro@@ ve the designation of insp@@ ectors of the organization , which is to be ob@@ struc@@ ted by this Convention , the Council is called the refusal to discuss appropriate measures with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The community and the concerned States undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the insp@@ ectors of the organisation , in accordance with their Convention , can actually perform tasks . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ectors of the organization are set up in such a way that i ) are as small as possible the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspection of peaceful nuclear activities ;
( II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the insp@@ ectors of the organization .
&quot; each State shall apply to the organization , including its assets , assets and assets , as well as to their insp@@ ectors and other officials , to enforce the provisions of the agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liber@@ als of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention are terminated in respect of core material , when the community and organisation determine that the material consum@@ es or has been dil@@ uted in such a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is under the viewpoint of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or has practically not become re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the Community notes the organization following this Convention on the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the safety measures pursuant to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated in respect of core material as soon as the recipient state , as stipulated in this Convention , has taken over responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organization performs documentation , from which any passing on and , if necessary , the re@@ application of securing measures on the given core material emerges . &quot;
&quot; should the core material be used in accordance with this Convention on non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , the community will agree with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the precau@@ tions can be terminated in accordance with this Convention concerning this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core spr@@ inkl@@ ers during the period of non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention .
B ) The Organisation and the Community shall make a regulation that the securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall not be applied as long as the core material is used for such activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these precau@@ tions are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the safety measures fores@@ een in this Convention will be re@@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the respective state or the states concerned , and on any transfer of such material from that state or states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its understanding as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include an endor@@ sement or a written knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs of increasing each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the creation of the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses due to a special request of the organisation , so the organisation reimbur@@ ses these costs as long as it has been agreed beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the insp@@ ectors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , on the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim claimed by the Community or the State vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Organization or the Organization to the Community or any State due to damages , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; according to the expert information provided by the Director General , the Council determines that the organisation must not be able to verify that no core material , which has to be defeated after this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take the appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council is taking into account the weight gained by the employed safety measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is affected - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Organization , the Community or a State , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the community and the states are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; all disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be lod@@ ged with the exception of disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another member of the Organization , the Community and the States , to submit to an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four appointed arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth who pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization shall not be named after the request for an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal by two arbitr@@ ators , the community or organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure applies if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the affected states . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ core @-@ states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is noted that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the Community of the Organisation has noted that it is able to apply its security measures , in relation to that State , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states are seeking one another to request one of the Parties to am@@ end this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Manager immediately teaches all Member States of the Organization immediately of any change in the Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that its procedures for entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States are contracting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures as necessary in the implementation of Part I provisions on securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the safety measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bi@@ fur@@ cation of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such a branch due to the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; to obtain the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone , which is not specified for a certain period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified parameters . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the organisation makes a full use of the Community &apos;s securing system after article 3 full use . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community of Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind and they , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are more determined and practical in supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of preserved , derived , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of removed core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ; &quot;
e ) procedures for assessing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a record and report system , which exhibits the core material continu@@ ance and the changes in this stock including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the precau@@ tionary measures after this Convention are not for material in mining or in the preparation of ore processing .
&quot; ( B ) The amount and composition of the material described under letter c ) shall be introduced into the states , so the community of the organization informs the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced to specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) Le@@ ads core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear waste @-@ cycle , is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the pre@@ conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of core material , the securing measures according to this Convention is not possible or desired , so the organization and the community consult each other about the use of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material , under the conditions specified in Article 13 , insofar as the organization and the community agree to conclude that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures according to the Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used on non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such a material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under the Convention , from these security measures , if the total material quantity delivered in the States at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 % ( 0.5 % ) , or below ; &quot;
&quot; if delivered core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ ards under this Convention , provisions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective realization of the tasks of the organization according to the Convention , in the individual , as the procedure defined in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without any modification of this Convention in agreement between the Organisation and the Community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements come into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the organization establishes a consolidated existing directory of the whole , the securing measures of this Convention under@@ lining the core material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory account for the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general health problems problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years following entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is apparent in what manner it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organisation establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; &quot; which is made up of the funds which member states contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is managed by the organization as an administrator of tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous and used ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; Man@@ age &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is separated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debt of the Member State , which , on demand , in the currency of the respective state , to pay for the organisation as an administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited at the establishment of the organisation in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or any other between the EEC and the appointed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at another time agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organisation , the administrator takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school blocks to cover expenses for the transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the provision of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided according to the conditions of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems , &quot;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to the lending conditions ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the concerned countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s programme of development , whether it is regarded , approved and managed by the pre@@ am@@ ble of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special transaction should not be used in place of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation in the context of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions which apply to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus , they are payable in 50 years at least 50 years . &quot;
&quot; the transaction loan is granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are payable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to the payment of this clock are to be made directly to the organization that maintains it .
&quot; each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services that are produced or . &quot;
&quot; the rep@@ ay@@ ment of capital rep@@ ay@@ ments shall be transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors until full allocation of all the special transaction loans .
&quot; during the time of the payout of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the EEC shall be informed quar@@ terly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses for this . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker con@@ veys the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year of the organisation a detailed account of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC communicated as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programmes financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the promotion account , which are drawn from the account recei@@ pts for financial obligations placed on the account and depos@@ ited from the account and the payments to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker will work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by the special transaction accounts and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may agree not into force , the agreement and all the obligations arising from it shall be eff@@ ected with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement , the total amount of capital received by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 shall be returned to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations arising from it shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States are notified to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications during the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter to change the Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT has issued the following rules : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; and THE SCH@@ WE@@ I@@ Z@@ ER@@ IS@@ CHE Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental plant , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Joint Company under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; since up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion still extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties to summ@@ ari@@ ze their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and their respective research work , which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement aims to enable every contracting party to be able to achieve unnecessary over@@ lap by combining their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided by the research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective power generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programs defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or amended in accordance with the provisions mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this will apply to the programs listed in Annex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realized by : - adequate participation of any of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - exchange of personnel under the laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the scope of this agreement , Switzerland will participate in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties are referred to an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those agreed between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom bears care that Switzerland is involved with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the project J@@ ET , Switzerland is part of the time of entering into force of the present agreement to the Joint Company J@@ ET , whose stat@@ ute is accepted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom bears care that Switzerland may become a contractual partner of any contract whose aim is to be included within the scope of the present agreement , except for association agreements or other similar tre@@ aties concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies responsible for carrying out the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement includes , in particular , the suspension of a steering committee , to the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; - To supervis@@ e the development of research work , and to guide the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by no more than two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom Programme , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , accepts this task with regard to all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes co @-@ ordination and co @-@ ordination between the affiliates and their T * in the interests of the two contracting parties on the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Procedure , the V@@ G shall appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Group groups , which support the V@@ G research proposals with regard to the fact that the means approved for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task with regard to all research and development work carried out in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom Programme . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacity of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , is fu@@ eling this task with regard to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , he is responsible for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of it between the laboratories involved in the conduct of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the coordination committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees that have appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , personnel and knowledge and skills necessary to carry out the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program assume this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F includes a responsible representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated Third State . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programs and defining their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the V@@ G to the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the area of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technical consult@@ ative bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount equivalent to the proportion of Eur@@ atom &apos;s controversial part at the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution is related to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as it is constructed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland as@@ signs an amount to the Joint Venture J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association of this Joint Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom serves to finance the works within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , will be calculated on the same basis that is normally made for the calculation of Eur@@ atom entries to finance the works , which are made due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with the amount to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme for the relevant year .
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the remaining terms of payment for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are stipulated in Annex III to the present agreement .
Switzerland takes all necessary measures in order to exemp@@ t Eur@@ atom from customs or other taxes as well as import restrictions and restrictions to the part of the items used in Switzerland for activities in the context of this agreement .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
&quot; I honour myself , on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on the import of lamb , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are considered as follows : &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or ch@@ illed lamb , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass @-@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual annual quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to traditional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form result from changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement shall consult one another before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community receives the prot@@ ec@@ torate , it ple@@ dges to bear in mind that the Argent@@ inian approach to the community market has not been touched by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year . &quot;
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement on a Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the quantity stipulated under number 2 in accordance with the scope of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ acy of the Ex@@ haus@@ tion will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount referred to under number 2 will be determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tons of batt@@ les@@ hip weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the paragraph of intervention orders on frozen meat is not under@@ mining the he@@ el of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb , are only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms must be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantity of export licenses specified in this Agreement shall be issued for the products specified under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community ple@@ dges to make all necessary arrangements , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is designated by the local government designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the deposit for issuing the import license can be wai@@ ved for the goods in question .
&quot; in addition , the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals requires the quantities to be issued for export licenses ; these data may be deco@@ ded according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and runs smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency on the lamb , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as sales conditions on these markets , including conditions , which are of importance for the target number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement of un@@ named tariff numbers according to the Community . &quot;

&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the height specified in the agreement . &quot;

the human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water which corresponds to the quantity of liquid , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 grams per litre and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) a dangerous content of in@@ som@@ em@@ oly@@ sin or immune ha@@ em@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine have been established are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the removal of the blood , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations , the signs of a bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation has to be proven in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to dimin@@ ish the danger of the transfer of I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ sh@@ es , mixtures are to be taken to apply mixtures that do not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods that are known to reduce this danger in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; the amount of fluid consumed during the production of the plasma must be added ; the substance must be completely detached from 15 to 20 C within 10 minutes . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination has to react with all tested blood samples containing the tigen containing the anti@@ body or another on the label given hom@@ olo@@ g .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ i@@ tions may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by continuously re @-@ di@@ lu@@ tion of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um di@@ lu@@ tion in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lu@@ tion is calculated excluding the volume of the blood cell flus@@ hing in the total volume .
&quot; in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has established international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present . &quot;
&quot; an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ation .
the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lu@@ tion of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series in which a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for the International standard preparations present ( at the time of Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in relation to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bulletin , O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows an example of a comparison of the International standard of Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown &quot; &quot; Anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ agent &quot; &quot; ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in flu@@ ffy form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory results test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the trials ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 v.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to satisfy the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; sera human origin for blood group determination needs to contain at least 2,5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ ffy or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in the form of a flu@@ ent form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain any sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally coloured as possible , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are in such a way and in such amounts to distribute that the re@@ agent contained in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity ordered in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to carry out written records of all production stages and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; reasonable samples of all re@@ agents spent are so long kept from the laboratory , until with some probability it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) of origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion ; the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective component . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each container a black printed label is to be fixed in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; having regard to Article 5 , paragraph 1 of the Convention that &quot; &quot; the contracting parties must take all necessary measures &quot; &quot; to free them from the other parties provided by the other parties , of human origin from all input fields ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this liberation in the competence of the community falls under the jurisdiction of the Community , which has been established by the Treaty by which it has been constituted , which has the necessary powers ; &quot;
&quot; from the time of its entry into force , this Additional Protocol is part of the Convention . from this date on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming a contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notes the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States Parties to the Convention and the European Economic Community each assumption or objection within the meaning of Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this Additional Protocol under Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the trade between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single paper ) , is used for all export and import procedures , as well as for goods traffic between the contracting parties ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; transit procedures &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the contractual obligations associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single document , for the pre @-@ printing after the patterns in Annex I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the standard paper is used as an application or paper for export , shipping procedures or import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; - to be explicitly requested to carry out the legislation applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the single documents ; &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to come into the enjoyment of a pre @-@ party or a certain relief , it may be required by the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Agreement does not prevent the contracting parties , simpli@@ fying procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The simplified procedure may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the concerned goods are not to be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not present at the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete application can be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an en@@ rol@@ ment must be made subsequently , in which it can act with the consent of the competent authorities in order to have a peri@@ odic collection registration , within the deadline established by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be allowed to use securities instead of the official documents . &quot;
&quot; if the single paper is used , the parties can attach to common lists , with the consent of the competent authorities , in place of the import@@ ation and import@@ ation of the leaf@@ lets , in which the goods are described in the trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the denom@@ inations for their entire goods traffic , or for sub @-@ areas ; &quot;
&quot; - for shipments containing several types of goods , to use the delivery charges in the shipping procedure charge eli@@ sten instead of the supplementary sheets for single paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow registrations to be created if , if necessary , by public or private data processing systems according to the conditions specified by the relevant authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - to allow the competent authorities to request the data required in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications in their data processing systems , if necessary , without giving any written application ; &quot;

I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its commission , referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; may ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations for the management of fish stocks and related issues , and the Council will come to this wish as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . faced with the Commission &apos;s responsibility to the management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to present all relevant reports of his working groups to assess the stock situation as well as the reports of his advising F@@ ish@@ eries Committee . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission are regularly advised on how the cooperation between the two parties can be intensified , and in particular examine the opportunities offered by the Commission to establish a closer connection with the advice of the Council &apos;s F@@ ish@@ eries Committee . &quot;
&quot; 4 . in the signature of this agreement , the Community will pay a sum of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ k@@ r and make annual payments . &quot;
the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings conven@@ ed on special request by the Commission .
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , its determin@@ ations will be re @-@ examined by both parties . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement shall be extended based on the existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
every party at any time has the possibility to withdraw from the agreement with a period of one year .

the Parties to the Agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a council for cooperation in the field of customs clearance .
&quot; in THE EV@@ AL@@ U@@ ATION that it is desirable that the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System , which was concluded in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE EV@@ AL@@ U@@ ATION , that without a change of Article 13 of the present Convention , the date of entry into force of this Convention would continue to remain in@@ secure - &quot;

5 . &quot; production &quot; means the quantity of regulated substances produced by the contracting parties to be dispos@@ ed of ;
&quot; 7 . &quot; &quot; calculated scope &quot; &quot; of production , imports , exports and consumption , in accordance with Article 3 determined amount ; &quot;
&quot; 8 . &quot; &quot; industrial ration@@ alisation &quot; &quot; means transferring the entire or part of the calculated volume of production from a contracting party to another to achieve economy or to react to expected supply defic@@ iencies due to operational clos@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) E@@ ach contracting party ensures that during the period of twelve months , the first day of the seventh month &quot;
