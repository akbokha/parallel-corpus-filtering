this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which it explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packing site ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of Mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Th@@ ose thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psychological illness , in which the patients have some periods of normal atmosphere altern@@ ating with periods of normal atmosphere . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of some episodes in patients who have been addressing the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in the case of both diseases , the solution can be used to treat or use the melting tablets in patients , to which the swal@@ lowing of tablets causes difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be reduced , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably appears primarily as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the brain activity , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re@@ occurrence . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent the re@@ occurrence of symptoms , was examined in three studies up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recovery , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder leading to increased anxiety involving Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic drug ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received a@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; when used to treat bi@@ polar disorder , a@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of some episodes in previously treated patients , and when it was administered additionally to an existing treatment . &quot;
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms of irrit@@ ated disorder more effectively than plac@@ ebo and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , Ac@@ ath@@ alie ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , trem@@ bling ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , ble@@ aching ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes involved in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the quick check of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with some episodes of bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , irrespective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; considering the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour is a result of psych@@ otic illnesses and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions which are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states that are associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ id or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk estim@@ ations for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ein patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see paragraph 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar can reductions . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism . &quot;
&quot; considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can can be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after applying the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose @-@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in reproduction studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , an overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ alie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , was compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS is 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ fem@@ oral treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those suffering from lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporal and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma exposure . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recep@@ tor @-@ lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ i@@ dol controlled trial , 52 percent of the respon@@ dents participated in the study in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery E@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sive rates chart , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significant higher reduction of the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational dual blind study for schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target of weight gain &apos; was significantly less than at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I fault , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I fault Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ i@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or semi @-@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated against plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xi@@ dation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabolism on CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients there are no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a population @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ did@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) at rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times of mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( from 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of found concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l are not more than 6 % of concentrations reported in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; rab@@ bits have observed these effects after doses , which lead to expos@@ ures of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated against plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets may alternatively use the enam@@ el tablets to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour is a result of psych@@ otic illnesses and aff@@ ective dys@@ functions , in some cases reported after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I fault , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo over 3 weeks . &quot;

it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational dual blind study for schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target of weight gain &apos; was significantly less than at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I fault Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , where the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in oral form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric mean mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets came to 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( from 1 to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

bili@@ fy inj@@ ections solution is used to quickly check det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with some episodes of the Bi@@ polar I fault if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended to the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle by b@@ yp@@ assing obes@@ e regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5,@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the drugs applied for preservation or ac@@ utely treatment ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy Solution . &quot;
there are no investigations to the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is deemed necessary , patients should be observed with regard to an extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
research on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , conduc@@ tive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions which are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( irregular beat or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to a deterioration of glu@@ cose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ein patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the intra@@ mus@@ cular dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) as an intr@@ amus@@ cular dose , and the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism can result in joint application with highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can can be performed . &quot;
&quot; after applying the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose @-@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral an@@ al@@ ari@@ d ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those suffering from lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporal and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , spi@@ der dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution combined with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements of A@@ gi@@ tier@@ eness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding the ag@@ ility and behaviour distur@@ ban@@ ces compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement observed from the bas@@ eline to the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour final was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ i@@ dol controlled trial , 52 percent of the respon@@ dents participated in the study in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and half @-@ op@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sive rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational dual blind study for schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target of weight gain &apos; was significantly less than at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially over 2 weeks did not refer to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l demonstrated against plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after offering the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a system@@ ic exposition ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ern@@ ally exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bit ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ did@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) at rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 @-@ times of moderate @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study involving 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if only the patients treated for metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time until the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who previously had other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was in patients where the first treatment did not suggest more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that it must not be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited company approval for the deployment of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in patients , in which the first line therapy for metast@@ atic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment the dose in the subsequent series should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; with sensory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose needs to be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for recommendations of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ it@@ em@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see paragraph 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot;
patients should not re @-@ use abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; kar@@ di@@ ale incidents in the individual patient group are not un@@ common , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ ema and con@@ sti@@ sting means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practise an effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; males who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child to bear . &quot;
&quot; before treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm dispens@@ ation , since treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects , such as ti@@ re@@ dness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ tin@@ ence and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most remarkable ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quick reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the eligi@@ bility of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in the blood of heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the chest of breast , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , dis@@ comfort in limbs , muscle weakness , Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al link was established with these events . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti @-@ doc@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the assembly of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes of tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their poly@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bul@@ b network , which is essential for the vital interaction and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
&quot; it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells , and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ escent transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umen recep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic mam@@ ma car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two un@@ blind , un@@ blin@@ ded trials and 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entri@@ c study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma who received chemotherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ as@@ els . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ atic and 19 % due to metast@@ atic and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy , are explained below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement by a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the complete @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance ex@@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or soft bonding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue histor@@ ies it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary exp@@ ul@@ sion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the total met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few dates are available for patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original cardboard and in light of light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ tic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) so@@ dium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane perme@@ ating bottle .
&quot; after completing the solution , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material . &quot;
&quot; then the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should be slowly and carefully fl@@ atten@@ ed and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until a complete final cleaning of the powder is done . &quot;

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorization for marketing authorization will provide the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials before the market launch :
&quot; • Training bro@@ sch@@ ure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport by the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ y@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood flow values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood pressure is not possible before the intervention and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body does not respond sufficiently to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enabled it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was referred to as an injection into a v@@ ein during a main study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a v@@ ein before they either were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected am@@ en@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were maintained in the same measure as in those patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed a rise of .0@@ 63 g / dl of initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sudden mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as other studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed is providing information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union to the company Medi@@ ć@@ ena P@@ üt@@ t GmbH &amp; Co KG . &quot;

&quot; treatment should be carried out only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in planned larger operative interventions that require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for women ; 5 or more blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden , so the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in is over 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
initial dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using intra@@ ven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden , so the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored closely to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permissible dose , which is necessary to check the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid number exceeds 4@@ 0.000 cells / µ@@ l versus the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in connection rises &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid count increased by ≥ 4@@ 0.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be kept three times a week . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te force increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l against the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ tations is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; as early as possible , iron sub@@ stitutes should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks prior to the beginning of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves at the start of the Ab@@ y@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively operate 300 I.@@ E. / kg respectively on 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a spray needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient inj@@ ections of the medication into the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at an Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ la@@ last@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) , should not obtain Ab@@ y@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ la@@ last@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or gr@@ under@@ ing diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ cl@@ eral disease , vas@@ cular disease of the cardi@@ ac or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardi@@ ac in@@ far@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ la@@ last@@ y ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of a vertical PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect defined as a decrease in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ f@@ usions , the recur@@ rence value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ target ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , risk of blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,@@ 0 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte figures are normal , and if no other reason for effective loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity for sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an@@ tic@@ ated PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In case of chronic kidney failure patients should not exceed the limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in the 4.2 @-@ recommended upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit which is due to the use of epo@@ e@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 .
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency that is not di@@ aly@@ sis is not accelerated , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chemotherapy , Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa prescription and er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin answer ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to keep the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ic an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on benefits @-@ risk @-@ weighing , involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients , which are intended for a greater orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should have adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an increased risk of post@@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events may exist in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial pre@@ disposition of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that it can improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was stri@@ ved
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood mirror of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis can be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rite . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on tumour tissue there is no evidence of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
&quot; through th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ ark@@ ens , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ ark@@ te , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .
&quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and related to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression of tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind plac@@ ebo controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in checks .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients , who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the ser@@ um mirrors that are reached after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last offering .
( bone mar@@ row fi@@ bro@@ sis is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be caused by secondary Hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated for three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fi@@ bro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with approximate 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal body weight , to a del@@ aying of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro fertili@@ sation with cells of human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for clinical situations . &quot;

&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood wor@@ m@@ wood with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa Gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your sever@@ ance dosage accordingly to minimize the risk of dro@@ ple@@ t formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there have already occurred th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or lung em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ y@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances neg@@ atively affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the start of treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ y@@ amed as an increased risk of dro@@ ple@@ t formation after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines , or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ y@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means for building up the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , you can , if your doctor considers this to be attached , also learn how to spray ab@@ se@@ amed itself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; cardi@@ ac , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ble@@ eding , stroke , transi@@ ent circulation distur@@ ban@@ ces of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , thro@@ mb@@ oses ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ ms ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;
&quot; ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke o@@ ops ) and shock@@ ing allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , re@@ dness , it@@ ching sensation , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ la@@ last@@ y means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is necessary &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - irrespective of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a dro@@ ple@@ t formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood sampling following surgery ( post@@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events ) if your initial background is too high

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been removed from the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or be rejected . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , which makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a sli@@ pper@@ y hip frac@@ ture as in the case of ha@@ ze ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125@@ ,000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle prior to the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may reduce the symptoms arising in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis of more than 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance is removed ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared with bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with elderly women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis surgery ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years in comparison with the patients below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis surgery ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients below plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions at the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ arthritis ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides educ@@ ative material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which explains how the medicine is applied , and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited approval for the launch of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication during pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy eating • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ ,000 I.@@ U. or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , as bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data for in@@ ability and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population . &quot;
&quot; prior to the beginning of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is to be treated with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental procedures , there are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk evaluation .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of severe side @-@ effects reported cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - recur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid has been associated with kidney function disorders resulting in kidney function ( i.e. an increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were compared to a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of the Ser@@ um cre@@ atine within 10 days of treatment was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the lab findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were reported , in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received suppl@@ em@@ ental intake of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture of hip frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local responses to the in@@ fusion site , such as re@@ dness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area were know@@ ingly , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw range ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental procedures . &quot;
&quot; 7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ arthritis in the oral part of a patient treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ic@@ a@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two mild or a medium @-@ heavy existing spine ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly exceeded a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduction in the risk of spine @-@ related frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised the bone density on the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the total hip of 6.0 % , of the scra@@ per @-@ throat by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic region .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in trab@@ ecular bone volumes compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of trab@@ ecular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; bone replacement mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of study . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value for 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D @-@ mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at the overall th@@ igh and neck elevation at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment carried out more than 24 months in comparison to the plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in the overall perf@@ ume and 4.@@ 3 % of the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) was once an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to the weekly dosing of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate related to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients aged 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially mild to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proven in two six month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as a response to the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responding to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach of 141 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bar rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early phases ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease in zone acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , hydrogen @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even ren@@ al dys@@ functional down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid .
&quot; since severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is only available with limited data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest not let@@ ally effective intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight . &quot;
&quot; in studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were 6@@ times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was administered in rats , given doses of 0.@@ 6@@ mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the four@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure based on the AU@@ C , equivalent ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure for cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common infection in studies with repeated application was an aug@@ mented primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity observed in rats from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
rab@@ bits were not observed ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced ser@@ um calcium levels .
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions prior to the application ; usually , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone was reached ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus paste of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by re @-@ norm@@ alized the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or need to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you are taking other medicines , or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , together with food and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions accurately so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before finishing treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a If you are considering ending treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms when you have received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; influ@@ enza , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , ti@@ re@@ dness , ting@@ ling / ting@@ ling , sensation , anxiety , stomach upset , stomach upset , stomach upset , stomach upset , stomach upset , stomach upset , irrit@@ ation , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue sh@@ utter and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported primarily in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , n@@ ett@@ le r@@ ash and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , the tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the side effects are significantly affected or you may notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; usually , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently released low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia develops whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently released low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ ,000 I.@@ U. or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packing site ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; compli@@ a is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , there were four studies involving more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for the cess@@ ation of smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with compli@@ a ? s The most common side effects of compli@@ a , which were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete listing of side effects reported in connection with compli@@ a is the package supplement . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression , and , among other things , can generate su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable with simultaneous use of compli@@ a with drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ asis my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of compli@@ a with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight
&quot; used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing explanations for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also exhibit one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data for efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive Dis@@ eases or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used for depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - in addition to obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons ) suggest that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately collect medical advice when these symptoms appear . l@@ n
• For@@ mer patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been demonstrated sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or stroke etc . ) before less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ) has not been studied , is believed that the simultaneous offering of potent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; over@@ weight patients as well as in patients with an obesity have been studied , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in additional indications . &quot;
the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects observed in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolic disorders .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ates ( for undes@@ irable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In assessing side effects the following frequencies are underlying :
&quot; very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ able study where a limited number of individuals were administered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and at the same time existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year for compli@@ a 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between compli@@ a and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . E@@ IM &quot;

&quot; in a second study in patients with an obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an output value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0,@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 below plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the plac@@ ebo group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference between the middle weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % induced by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; 2 hours reached , the Ste@@ ady state plasma bar was reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1.6 ± 14,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of food intake , he showed a 67 % higher C@@ max or by 48 % raised n@@ g AU@@ C in the case of food intake . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have one up to 31 % lower C@@ max and one by 43 % lower AU@@ C have as patients of other ethnic populations .
n Pop@@ ular Analysis ( Age Range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following undes@@ irable effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred n@@ g in animals after exposure in the human@@ istic area , have been evaluated as potentially relevant for the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress seems to be associated with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on fertility or cycle distur@@ ban@@ ces were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exhibition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which it explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be adequately controlled with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ phon@@ ate or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ ate or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , so type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was evaluated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ y study , the effect of an additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ ate resin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional treatment of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin has been studied in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin presented a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , respiratory infections , weight gain and hypo@@ b@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( for sole use ) should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , with which met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin , and with which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to use Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years , so the use in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardi@@ ac in@@ far@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes can be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , upper stomach upset , ti@@ re@@ dness , appetite loss and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are presented .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be ag@@ itated by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral tw@@ o- or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as two @-@ course combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ons , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or deterioration of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but dec@@ aying doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , if patients report about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological elu@@ ci@@ fication should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of becoming pregnant , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ tas@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in a 3 @-@ fold increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in 54 % reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , hyper@@ insulin @-@ induced hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance are reduced and increased the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary alteration of the tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege over thre@@ ef@@ old of the upper limit of the standard range was equally common to plac@@ ebo , but less rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than below plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported on heart failure among Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , it is more common when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparison medications . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ation inhibit@@ or ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cose level in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the treatment of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value was 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qui@@ ot@@ ien@@ ds compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as tri@@ vial , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d reduce overall plas@@ tic@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diab@@ etic and cardiovascular treatment either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly absorbed , with peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma removal rate of un@@ changing pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated dose of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance are reduced and increased the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) induced by the ur@@ inary bladder .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ t tum@@ ours .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qui@@ ot@@ ien@@ ds compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only improved the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study showed the aim of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation over the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular risk risks are connected . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on a side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparative medication , showed an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was evaluated in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ ke suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list can be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane weigh over the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary during initial dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals have to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor therefore has to consider potential interactions during therapy and always ask his patients after other drugs taken .

&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of operation is up to 24 hours . &quot;
the res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; additionally , the doses of acet@@ yl@@ pi@@ d may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , it may be necessary during initial dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to that insulin and meals have to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of operation is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data is limited , however , suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile is similar in children and adolescents to young adults . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ inate @-@ crystalline deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter for two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that at least during the first six months , patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic are taking other medicines to prevent g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant , as it was not studied for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first trial where 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to that of a plac@@ ebo ( head@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ uri@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who included Aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily consumed 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to prim@@ ate deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present toxic@@ ity and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , effectiveness and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , as there is no experience with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ tation recep@@ tor Since there is no experience in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , the use of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency the treatment with F@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ saw drugs , it may occur during the treatment course to an acute g@@ out attack because of the reduction of the ser@@ um acid pi@@ erc@@ ing initially , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobili@@ sed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so common that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials , light incidence of liver function values were observed with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry out liver function test before beginning of the F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ect@@ omy and in the subsequent process ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ ones did not perform interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a blocking of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous offering of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ oo@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ ic acid / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for F@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
&quot; in a study with subjects applied 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ or effect from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of a ant@@ acid which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed intake of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fo@@ etus / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when using a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not adver@@ sely affected . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardi@@ ac events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebru@@ ary group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences have been found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be found . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the hospital history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rhe@@ a nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials there were no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
&quot; 7 Open long term extension studies in the open long term extension studies were treated with 906 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ oo@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these cans or with a lower frequency :

&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three month defined ser@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ mental value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the traditionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor visit in week 2 and continued permanently throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the process of the ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects without their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( Bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of phase 3 revealed that the permanent decrease of the ser@@ um acid levels at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in incidence of gi@@ g@@ ings ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a g@@ out delay ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the gir@@ th node size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des up to the month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration are simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decline in ser@@ um acid concentration has been observed , provided that it has been checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at plasma glu@@ ing is about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found as an un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool were found as an un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took around the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , about the 11 times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are considered as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ gest@@ ation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats has .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were about thre@@ ef@@ old of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by a reduction in the incidence of sugar and a develop@@ mental delay in the desc@@ end@@ ents of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which roughly 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 can already be used separately from one another in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of enhancing the vitamin D spi@@ ke .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , exactly corresponds to the dose needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diges@@ tive disorders ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing stomach ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en , as well as s@@ nu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in the case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or dis@@ solve the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eye op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients with taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these severe and required a hospital exp@@ ul@@ sion ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor should alert attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be informed of the occurrence of symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation , such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or deterior@@ ating heart@@ burn , and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of serious mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms pointing to mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions can be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , they were rarely ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy g@@ ime mainly contains intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether susp@@ ecting a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients , who require a max@@ il@@ ular surgery , reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before starting treatment .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some oral drugs may imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without the clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by lac@@ t@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients but it was reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
&quot; nevertheless , taking the ser@@ um calcium up to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ stead of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract like stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cholesterol to vitamin D3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1,@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal Res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary Hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8,@@ 8 % on the spinal column , 5.8 % at Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.8 % on the drum . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6,@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ ver@@ ters continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ age neck and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % vis @-@ à @-@ vis Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption onto an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the medi@@ al bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before acceptance of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) leads to no clin@@ ically significant alteration of the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats showed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fung@@ us . &quot;
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; at rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the elimination of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In the dose of radio@@ active marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the fung@@ us after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a slightly increased g@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bones ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients with a kidney or liver tran@@ spl@@ ant to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft have already been used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , whereby the use of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients , in which the transplan@@ tation was abor@@ ted after a treatment period of one year ( by examining how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter additional studies in 119 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were conducted and studied , such as Adv@@ agra@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this medication or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; following a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is maintained . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood level determin@@ ations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirrors were to be monitored before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure was comparable to the valley of the valley , with both form@@ ulations both in case of kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant patients . &quot;
careful and re@@ peti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the direct follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the can agra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The or@@ ale Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The or@@ ale Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted into a tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f so this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection .
&quot; heart tran@@ spl@@ ant For adult patients , which are switched to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day should be taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients though there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and anal transplan@@ ts , occurred in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , at pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts in an oral dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; dosage Adju@@ st@@ ment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the intended area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders , a reduction of the dose . &quot;
&quot; since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , patients with reduced kidney function can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the cre@@ atine in@@ insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ atine within and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to Adv@@ agra@@ f When converting a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirrors controls .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; the blood @-@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled following conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ ing Adju@@ st@@ ment , Chang@@ es of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the down@@ stroke of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml , and with adren@@ al transplan@@ ts at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ - or Ex@@ pos@@ ure exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation advoc@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients and gra@@ fts in childhood , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation advoc@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ b level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may contain , or other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trophy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy could be observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective device with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f &apos;s hard capsule , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose is included , special caution is recommended in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , thus increasing or decreasing the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror is recommended to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even concentrations corresponding ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction with anti@@ fung@@ ici@@ ans such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in the blood mirror mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or reduce the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , precau@@ tions about precau@@ tionary measures should be taken particularly cau@@ ti@@ ously . &quot;
the results of animal testing showed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the clearance between pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and prolon@@ gs their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on tran@@ spl@@ ant patients have no indication that in comparison with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for event@@ ual adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following the side effects are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progres@@ si@@ ver multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ eins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the impact mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level should be convey@@ ed to the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of sign@@ aling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor . &quot;

&quot; 175 lung @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic treatment and in 630 patients treated as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant in 630 patients . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
lung transplan@@ tation In an intermediate analysis over a recent multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported more than 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract # 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; compared to 38.@@ 0 % of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in 21.@@ 7 % of cases compared to 38.@@ 0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were switched from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection came , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.8 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group increased ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a multi @-@ centric trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients , who received a Pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , who received a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target levels of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ uation between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently recently tran@@ spl@@ ant radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors like a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ on and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the tran@@ spl@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the elimination mainly occurs over bile . &quot;
&quot; for stable patients , which were switched from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) related to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be treated as therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation advoc@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; 28 confirmed acute out@@ casts were 32.@@ 6 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 237 ) , 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 234 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is applied to treat hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or to prevent ble@@ eding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which enables them to form the human scent factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced in a different way so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the drug was used to prevent ble@@ eding and surgical procedures . &quot;
the main study assessed the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ eci@@ des with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the launch of Adv@@ ate throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the dosage and duration of the substitu@@ tion therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the VIII @-@ defect factor , on the location and the extent of the ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII @-@ Activity should not fall under the specified plasma bar ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients below 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed . &quot;
repeat all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients below 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment procedure , the recommended dose and frequency of inj@@ ections will be recommended to control the factor VIII @-@ plasma bar . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII , which can be achieved in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ tim@@ el@@ ines . &quot;
3 Prevention for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dosage velocity should be adjusted after the patient &apos;s notice , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII directed by Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma through modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , with the risk inherent in the first 20 Ex@@ posi@@ tional Days and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in the case of previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product was observed to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women , there is no experience about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; in the largest number of patients appearing A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;

a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total number of individual patients ( 234 ) The unexpected drop of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th post@@ operative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
&quot; during all the time , the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained and both the factor VIII and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th post@@ operative day . &quot;
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE at 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 erup@@ tions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was found after exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
previously untreated patients undergoing an ongoing clinical trial were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AN@@ C treated patients against factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analyzed by the study of anti@@ body antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the occurrence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product items as part of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ ic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
&quot; the factor VIII , activated by factor VIII , acts as a factor of factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of factor X by factor X . &quot;
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in previously untreated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline value of the factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still evaluated the benefit risk balance , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that combines , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
it is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 @-@ protein , which is formed from the defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; on Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the documents initially submitted , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours has advantages for patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently proved that adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to poll@@ en caused by allergi@@ es ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main exposure measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who alone took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from acute glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiovascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) or have a risk for hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to lack of data , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to lack of data . &quot;
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment may be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after termination of such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Er@@ got@@ amin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , Eph@@ ed@@ rine , O@@ xy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dos@@ ages .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or strengthening head@@ ache ) must be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be canc@@ eled at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , because anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their degree . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be detected between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not in@@ hibit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of applying aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a di@@ version that can result in impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ani@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als . &quot;

&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary di@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin re@@ dness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human master cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ sel@@ ectivity on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 m@@ g. no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause more sympath@@ etic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling influence , determined by the nose @-@ mu@@ zzle , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ tal application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flowing balance was achieved by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were poor@@ ly metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure after offering an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not be recognized by humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the contents of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen at the oral dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 , the drug vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works , before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drinking or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you can be particularly sensitive to the gin@@ gi@@ val spon@@ ge of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this drug . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if there are symptoms or illnesses associated with you under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • Hyper@@ tension • Heart ch@@ ase , heart beat , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache or strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when applying in the recommended dosage , there is no indication that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or lowers the attention . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , then you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the above @-@ side effects are significantly affected or you may notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ett@@ ling and swelling ) or r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , ga@@ stri@@ c pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , di@@ zz@@ iness , in@@ suff@@ iciency with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous h@@ ep@@ atic values was also reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for intake ( solu@@ ble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children ages 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had as@@ thma ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy was measured by det@@ ecting the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ gles , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of am@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom score ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , in comparison to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the recur@@ rence of the symptom was after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued SP Europe a permit for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies to efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should take place according to the previous disease progression and can be res@@ um@@ ed after the symptoms of symptoms and res@@ um@@ ed .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended for a prolonged treatment during the allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while ing@@ es@@ tion of eri@@ us and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it may occur too , which can result in impair@@ ment of traffic consistency or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects reported more often than plac@@ ebo , fatigue was ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect head@@ ache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human master cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on sm@@ ol@@ ek@@ ü@@ ls P @-@ sel@@ ectivity on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; a single dose study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and re@@ dness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ en@@ nial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and per@@ en@@ nial allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
&quot; persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as a symptom of 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated from the overall scores of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was evaluated on behalf of further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar despite e@@ eti@@ ology in different forms and can be quickly prosp@@ ectively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; because the hi@@ stam@@ ine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ an@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms except in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were compared , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant g@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can not identify particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ bri@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ bri@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract or anatom@@ ic an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 are limited in the metabolic de@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience higher levels of substances ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children from 2 to 11 years of age that are physically metaboli@@ zed is identical to that in children that are normally metaboli@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine should not take . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged 1 to 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ do@@ sis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied daily over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied daily in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults showed no leng@@ th@@ ening of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed .
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not affected by the psych@@ omot@@ or in clinical studies in adults and adolescents in clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not increase neither alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and re@@ dness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated from the overall scores of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study involving sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are constra@@ ined .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
&quot; there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation , after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot;
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to those recommended in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III bra@@ id bottles with child @-@ proof poly@@ propylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ s@@ ats must be removed without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat became well toler@@ ated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied daily over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied daily in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied more than ten days , no leng@@ th@@ ening of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a 17 single dose study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and re@@ dness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated from the overall scores of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were compared , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet must be removed without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and not significantly from the safety profile specified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ z@@ tab@@ lette turned out to be a bio@@ equivalent to the eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied daily over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed 5 m@@ g. no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients aged 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

an A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melting tablet once daily in the mouth to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed cheese proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study with multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied daily over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; a 30 single dose study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and re@@ dness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ sat for intake the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical error tests for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical use .
the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children from 2 to 11 years of age that are physically metaboli@@ zed is identical to that in children that are normally metaboli@@ zed .
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine should not take . &quot;
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group .
&quot; inf@@ ants aged between 6 and 23 months were the most frequent side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was observed in case of no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ en@@ nial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can , depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated from the overall scores of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ conj@@ unc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no Bio@@ equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable to those recommended in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. granted approval to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for approval for the launch of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from humans to humans , because people have not yet built imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; &quot; in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to establish rapid antibodies in a contact with a flu virus of this tribe . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane h@@ ull of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which det@@ ects the human body as a foreign agent ) , and is used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
generic drugs should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus will respond to the medicine .
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , aspir@@ ation reduces the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS cannot cure , but can delay the damage of the immune system and hence the development of infections associated with AIDS and diseases . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs have been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , reinforced with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to 206 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo , but generic drugs were less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but with the children treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , this treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generic gases may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; generic drugs may not be used in patients , the Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded in the same way as aspir@@ in and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take aspir@@ ation are the risk of Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ generating immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of aspir@@ ation in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of a@@ we in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was presented . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs are used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , aspir@@ ation capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ st@@ aging of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of aspir@@ ation ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ asis Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ ef@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ash gases in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; generic gases are not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ation must not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ dium 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations which contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ ero does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; generally , aspir@@ in capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous antibiotic treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis have increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of ast@@ er@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ res@@ sing of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of v@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including r@@ hu@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of the reduced plasma bar of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ generic solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ogen@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which medications were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug depend@@ ant factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; at the time of launching an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ dium 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with drugs whose agents are mainly metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine caused a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
trying to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma bars by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been observed very frequently unwanted effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ rus mirrors and , if possible , check the virus load and remove the cur@@ rant . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , by contrast , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
&quot; 52 % reduced when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and in@@ compatibility of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was not a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended for at least one hour due to the imagin@@ ative component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposition of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may be drow@@ ned by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s ser@@ um concentration .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised to be less effective because of the reduced or potentially sub@@ therapeutic plasma bars . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision is to be performed as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ d is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous delivery of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and with it an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ast@@ er@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could increase the plasma bar of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ hen@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with a@@ vert , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ast@@ er@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as aspir@@ ation as it can result in res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ va , known as enzyme products ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma bar of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rock@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , and ni@@ modi@@ pine , may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with a@@ ero can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and increase side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma bar increased by about 86 % ( 90 % fi@@ del@@ ity interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous delivery of a@@ we with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cc@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases of the plasma bar are expected at the same time with v@@ ast@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma melt increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hu@@ dom@@ ite oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended for more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the same time as Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , aspir@@ in may not be used together with oral bi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to use generic mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible rise in the plasma bars of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fa@@ che .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the low perme@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adapted when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ it , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous use of ag@@ generic ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk for humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ st@@ ung to the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight in the seed . &quot;
the further development of seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the harm@@ lessness of aspir@@ ation was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely lead to treatment break@@ age . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking a@@ vert or other medicines to treat HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1,@@ 200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were classified by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medicine and were performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ wn sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ven@@ ous and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients treated with am@@ pren@@ ef@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine over a mean time of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acles ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without itch and occurred spontane@@ ously during the second week of treatment and van@@ ished spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with a severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ ist infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , species and frequency of side @-@ effects ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were similar to those received in patients who received a@@ generation together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observ@@ able at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral ag@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein stages with the consequence of an education in@@ mature , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viruses , not previously treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ hen@@ avi@@ r with 100mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which a virus failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those observed in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , V@@ 82@@ A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ire avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients with virus failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations occurred : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to f@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased chance of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
firms that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remain generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ p avi@@ r resist@@ ances , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses , not previously treated patients ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ations . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits resulting in subsequent treatment .
&quot; the proof of efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( virus load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) , with a PI mainly treated with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ cor@@ tical ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ vert , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis assessed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group with regard to time @-@ adjusted aver@@ aging from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ cap@@ illary threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ published aspir@@ ation is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI previously treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ generic .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , treatment optimisation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ cooked &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after oral dosage , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % lowered , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ ef@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of absorption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amber that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amber remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the overall dosage concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with v@@ ast@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily viral blast exposition as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and aspir@@ ation capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be minimal on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to Am@@ pren@@ ef@@ r plasma bars comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance to these findings from the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither suspected nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of aspir@@ ation nor after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at the age of 4 , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that point to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ st@@ aging ) , higher doses must be applied to ast@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ asis Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ ef@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug depend@@ ant factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine caused a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , by contrast , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given ; however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and in@@ compatibility of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposition of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision is to be performed as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ d is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rock@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , and ni@@ modi@@ pine , may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma bar increased by about 86 % ( 90 % fi@@ del@@ ity interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with a@@ it , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % res@@ p .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ st@@ ung to the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of aspir@@ ation was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observ@@ able at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , treatment optimisation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ cooked &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amber remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval depends on the overall dosage concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with v@@ ast@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be minimal on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ v@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.8 times ( rat ) of exposure to man after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance to these findings from the present exposure data on the human being , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al detection at human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither suspected nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at the age of 4 , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young people the metabolism path@@ ways are not fully mature , so Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical elements of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; generic drugs are used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake was not occupied with PI previously treated patients or with PI previously treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ asis is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ ef@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of ag@@ generic solution for taking and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination in these patient groups is avoided . &quot;
&quot; although dose adaptation for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a peti@@ tive in@@ hibition of metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ ero does not prevent the risk of being transmitted from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine caused a 82 % decrease in AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , by contrast , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with a@@ ero can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and lead related side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
based on the data to 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral dosing of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ generic solution to intake may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of fo@@ etus to the included Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk for humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ st@@ ung to the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 55 body weight in the seed . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of aspir@@ ation was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking a@@ vert or other medicines to treat HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viruses , not previously treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a promising 60 treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits resulting in subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , treatment optimisation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ cooked &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ation . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large volume of c@@ ous@@ ins as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that point to a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ ye@@ th@@ ylene gly@@ col 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , Ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am @-@ Kali@@ um , Sac@@ char@@ in @-@ so@@ dium , so@@ dium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , so@@ dium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the treatment frequency and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo had either applied daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions at the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c , not hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c ( AK@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p at immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or the number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can continue until all visible stu@@ ds have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al@@ gia or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and cleaned in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully trac@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily por@@ ters were performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with a stri@@ pping of leading stri@@ k@@ tur were observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed even under appropriate application , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous use means for the treatment of external fung@@ ici@@ ents in the genital and per@@ peri@@ al area , there are currently no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicates a higher rate of IO@@ P reduction in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair attachment has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment interval of several days may be made . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment is completed .
&quot; since there are currently no data available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ally modified bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience , therefore it is not recommended to use previously untreated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treating ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose in the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support effectiveness in this purpose , so such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions often occur but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if local skin reactions cause large dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 active L@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after multiple top@@ ical use quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly communicated and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in trials with three times weekly treatment were local responses at the place of treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and most likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side @-@ effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effect , were a reaction at the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) in these studies . &quot;
the side effects identified by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; this according to the review plan shown by the clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently led to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ o@@ ori@@ ation / ab@@ lation / shed ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the review plan shown by the clinical signs shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe weakness and em@@ ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dentally unique oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous liquid release . &quot;
&quot; after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing system@@ ic concentrations of the alp@@ ha@@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation . &quot;
&quot; in 3 phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy showed that efficacy in relation to a full healing of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts with an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was significantly superior over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ based patients ( 95 % CI :
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fic@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c file l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the first @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications External fin@@ ders , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ vis@@ ite bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or .
a minimal system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with active nucle@@ us was observed during the three @-@ three week application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml at the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates a prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with active nucle@@ us or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; another four @-@ month study to der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects with the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with mal@@ low administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not suspected , there is a risk to the human being due to system@@ ic exposure to be very low . &quot;
tum@@ ours performed in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream before and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

&quot; if left untreated , it can result in distor@@ tions , especially in the face - that is why early detection and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who have been exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lifetime . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a should be applied only with flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the super@@ ficial c@@ ac@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the tin@@ c@@ ous ker@@ at@@ osis or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or any other similar preparations before you start treatment . o inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the treated area after a previous medical treatment or surgical treatment is cured . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact the cream is removed by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o Do not use the cream internally . o Do not use more cream than your doctor prescribed you . o If reactions occur in the treated place , which will give you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the reactions are removed , you can continue the treatment . o Find your doctor if they don &apos;t have a normal blood picture &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleansing is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling or swelling of the skin or difficulties can be expected when treating the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a Cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cer@@ vi@@ x ( cer@@ vi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other medicines to have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have sexual intercourse during the infection with F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is performed . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream because it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od enters breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different with pasta , bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream on the clean , dry skin place with the pasta and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully trac@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; men with war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; &quot; What must you consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , 5 days a week in a row , apply a sufficient amount of al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too much to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more pr@@ one to infection ; it can cause a blue stain to arise more quickly or they can cause dis@@ comfort .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the above side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ chin@@ ess ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; usually these are lighter skin reactions , which sound within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment is removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes at the application site ( wound secre@@ tions , inflammation , swelling , atro@@ phy , irrit@@ ation , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes at the application site ( blood , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , ul@@ cer@@ ation , heat feeling or dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of the nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ ous , ul@@ cer@@ ation , facial swelling , ul@@ c@@ pain , cereb@@ ral pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ tin I ( MPS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves in connection ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of MPS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , which ag@@ grav@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , oste@@ opor@@ osis ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients , which may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and update it whenever necessary . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who are receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , observing the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. appro@@ ving the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ tin I ( MPS I , α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates it every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usi@@ onal reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or to the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in the recovery facilities available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usi@@ onal reaction need to be treated with caution in the application of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is little experience in the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment has to be handled cau@@ ti@@ ously . &quot;
60 minutes before starting in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ise potential occurrence of inf@@ usions caused by inf@@ usions .
the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usi@@ onal reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be re @-@ recorded with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with intra@@ ocular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data to new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to breast@@ feed while treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly prescribed as inf@@ usi@@ onal reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants of less than 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe MPS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper air@@ ways and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children undes@@ irable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe delay and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version was performed within 3 months of the treatment , with a more severe delay in the patients aged 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect antibodies by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ ul@@ c@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients , in which it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with low to low levels of antibodies showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ der in the urine , while in patients with high anti@@ body agents a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine could be determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies appeared not to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the justification for the enz@@ ym@@ atic replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme activity .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which recorded the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ ator@@ ic volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute foot@@ path in the 6 minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in the lung function and the ability to respond to patients treated in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased in proportion to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was detected in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation among patients , which has been taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes summ@@ ari@@ zes for five effectiv@@ ity variable ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , movement area of the shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was carried out , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe ent@@ ree form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe ent@@ ree form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe delay shape were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were conducted on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ up test . &quot;
&quot; intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to that of patients with older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in time @-@ to @-@ time toxic@@ ity toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot identify particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
a reaction @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines , or have recently taken it , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lu@@ tion and application The concentr@@ ates for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this and increases every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe MPS @-@ related involvement of upper air@@ ways and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( Performance for more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nau@@ sea • abdominal pain • skin r@@ ash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • red@@ dening • F@@ ever • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8@@ º C to be stored , provided that the di@@ lu@@ tion was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma @-@ In@@ fusion ( by as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on body weight of the individual patient first the number of di@@ lu@@ ent stre@@ ak bottles .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) , if the cancer is &quot; &quot; non @-@ ref@@ utable &quot; &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metast@@ atic &quot; &quot; non @-@ small &quot; &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin ( medicines for v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of hydr@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood type changes or where certain other side effects may occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed or removed or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to share .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to maintain than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural hel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 month , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , patients had longer periods of survival than with the comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to sell A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % so@@ dium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of necessary doses is taken from the pi@@ ping bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % so@@ dium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for overl@@ apping plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ op@@ ha@@ cal advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ single bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the emet@@ ric in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ id must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 cans of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g. ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third operation cycle .
&quot; patients who receive P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should be given a complete blood picture before each offering , including the differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ y@@ tes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ re blood current or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous h@@ ative therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted before the patient receives the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 doses of dose a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues at occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years old , or over 65 years old , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot;
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ atine release of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver dysfunction of &gt; to 1.5 times the upper bili@@ ru@@ by bor@@ der@@ - and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to 3,@@ 0 times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) are not studied especially in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with respect to bone @-@ level suppression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number once again a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ esi@@ ology toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was ob@@ s@@ cured when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ anic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent must be considered before P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should be noted , men should be advised before treatment to collect advice regarding the conservation of sperm . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can result in a reduced occurrence of side @-@ effects .
caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ising 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected when used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should be noted , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of semen . &quot;
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed enters breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial and were random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed - and 163 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial that were random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; side effects of frequency : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) and not known ( based on the available data from spontaneous reports ) . &quot;

&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the consolidated results of three single P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy studies , except neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal base values of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of undes@@ irable effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with N@@ SC@@ LC , which were random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed and 8@@ 30 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC that were random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine . &quot;

&quot; clinical trials were reported in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment occasionally cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal ble@@ eding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
&quot; from clinical studies , patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before during or after their P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed works as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several attacks by blocking the Thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ Lat@@ Syn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) - the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes from the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , single @-@ blind phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically significant survival compared to those patients treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients treated in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms result in an improvement of the lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and an in@@ timi@@ dation of the lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy reported medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the survival effect on overall survival fell into favour of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0,@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.00 , p = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.00 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Pop@@ ulation are consistent with the analyses of IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 33,@@ 9 ) for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the impact of N@@ SC@@ LC Hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the overall population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ level limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , patients needed the treatment of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0,@@ 004 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed as a mon@@ otherap@@ ic were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ors in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total surface of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs that had received intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ etus inj@@ ections for 9 months , tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( deport@@ ation / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; if not less applied , the retention periods and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lu@@ tion has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; solve the content of 100 mg pi@@ per bottles with 4.2 ml 0.9 % so@@ dium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ v@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed . &quot;
the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without the product quality is imp@@ aired .
each pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0.9 % so@@ dium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .

&quot; it is used for over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not remove some fats in the food , thereby causing approximately one quarter of fats to be fed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed with food . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg , recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients relevant weight loss .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with step lab@@ ori@@ zation , mar@@ h@@ ld@@ om , o@@ ily / o@@ ily fa@@ eces ( f@@ ences ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the deployment of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
All@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ dic , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
All@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , the or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • A lac@@ tation period ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or chem@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etic medication needs to be adapted . &quot;
&quot; patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted . &quot;
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interactions of medicines and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bar was observed .
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers were observed at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are connected with the pharmac@@ ological action of the drug , since absorption of taken fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) . &quot;
the incidence of side effects identified after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to con@@ ges@@ tion with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose cases reported after market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on human and animal studies , a rapid back @-@ formation of any system@@ ic effects deri@@ ving from the li@@ pas@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect rests in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine remnant of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pi@@ a .
&quot; clinical studies derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ yp@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies , weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference was the average change of -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not yet metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral dose of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in the case of therapeutic doses , not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of g@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , whom the minimal system@@ ic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ed dose was administered , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ t@@ ine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of the overall plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ v@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified as a special threat to humans . &quot;

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment commen@@ ces , since at this time you may have not consistently reduced the fat content in your diet . &quot;
• Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and the size of the portions that you normally take .
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly on your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a cl@@ assy neighbor , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • You are not allowed to use the exp@@ iry date specified on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases , such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • cardi@@ ac disease • stroke • Reg@@ ular canc@@ ers • oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases . &quot;
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take a maximum per day . &quot;
• The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; which quantity is appropriate for you , refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories you are suitable for . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle that amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional defic@@ iencies . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously approximately 0,5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can work daily just little or not , stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the regular trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
&quot; patients under 18 years of age are not recommended , as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient is the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , which prevents recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies involving 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 out of 223 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 by 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union to the company of Helsin@@ n Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in severe ven@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored closely after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is intended to be used either for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hibit tumor @-@ oriented activity of the five chem@@ otherap@@ ies studied ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous offering of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ o@@ e@@ tin , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience in the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ures is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials the most common side effects were observed in a dose of 250 mc@@ g. ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the meeting ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ activity relationships observed .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy in a dose of alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ ato@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cis@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.4 hours ) received , which was given on day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the promotional potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ a. arranged pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ ma@@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.3 @-@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 was measured . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations suggest that at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was comparable to the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg measured . however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ off of 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on metabolism , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; following a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous fis@@ her injection in healthy eyes , the total body size was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the terminal elim@@ inations time and the average system@@ ic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 pre@@ clinical trials suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose accounted for about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver canc@@ ers , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al drops ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats but not mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is very low for humans . &quot;
the propriet@@ or of this authorization must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the drug approved in the context of this decision .
&quot; • If any of the above @-@ side effects are severely affected or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor . &quot;
• Alo@@ xi is a clear , color@@ less injection solution for inj@@ ecting into a v@@ ein . • The active substance ( Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ) is a group of drugs called ser@@ oton@@ in ( 5@@ HT@@ 3 ) antagon@@ ists . • Alo@@ is is used to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting associated with chemotherapy for cancer . &quot;
&quot; 21 For use by Alo@@ xi with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking other medicines , or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommended to prescri@@ be 6 million IE / ml injection solution to the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood ab@@ normally . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment were treated to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood reported ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug market should not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
&quot; following the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease mut@@ ated again in more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test used in the study to investigate the question to what extent the drug is immune to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , scrat@@ ches and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for treating infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age should not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was rejected at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients from plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected cells , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken into consideration by household customers , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ und@@ ations , scrat@@ ches or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation due to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection is begun . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections with which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies on secondary un@@ infected open wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were reached after top@@ ical application on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous oral dosage of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on s@@ me@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered necessary if top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; in deciding if breast@@ feeding continues / ends or therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effect Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the meeting place , which viewed about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance extracted by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ och@@ ial ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis due to interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that distinguishes itself from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding point and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
&quot; linked to this binding point P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hibit Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance to the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in vitro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ interest to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and imp@@ aired skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary un@@ infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients prior to the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of the people after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 of S@@ alo@@ on ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ( see Section 4.5 ) of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or -@@ B vaccine may be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by att@@ aching the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the approved vaccine for Twin@@ et adults since 1996 and the V@@ Twin@@ rix children &apos;s approved vaccine since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts were also used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective anti@@ body concentration for one month after the last injection . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix suffered from 98 to 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti@@ body concentrations for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appetite deficiency , pain at the injection point , re@@ dness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix throughout the whole world . &quot;
&quot; the standard plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , taking the first dose at the appointment of the election and the second dose administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body levels are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the dosing of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of the formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , under certain circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s anti@@ body is achieved , so that in these cases the offering of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; because an intra@@ ocular injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact on the glut@@ eal muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , when thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases according to intr@@ amus@@ cular ability to ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us flight @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined Mas@@ er@@ - Mum@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ le vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , re@@ dness , swelling , pol@@ arity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever is comparable to the frequency observed in the former thi@@ quity and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ch@@ edness on a calculation base per vaccine dosage Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.8 % of the subjects compared with 39.@@ 1 % in subjects following the gift of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects had received the Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of skill was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ch@@ edness was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ination , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of the formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ inations that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units with the combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical studies conducted at vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years , the servo @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the servo @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rats ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after dosing of the 3 dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the imm@@ unity obtained in a clinical comparative study from 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ in@@ ers received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of the formal hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that , which was determined after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of de@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year was administered simultaneously with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us V@@ rub@@ ella vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined Mas@@ er@@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ le vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and server conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ p@@ ection to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; pursuant to Rule 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge approval is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow searches ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus before the submission of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill ) , an ino@@ cul@@ ation may not prevent a disease . &quot;
&quot; protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child already showed an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vaccine ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a viral hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s immune system or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child receive more medicines / receive ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without en@@ rol@@ ment ) , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated or have received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( anti@@ body ) or have been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response on the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be administered pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known for placing the first approval for the market launch , the CH@@ MP represented the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ rix used only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( cereb@@ ral damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or using plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without drugs ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , irrit@@ ability , loss of fluid , irrit@@ ation , pain , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unwanted body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps in patients with dis@@ ruptions in the ure@@ a cycle have effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ astic was approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug is present . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ born babies ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication of the use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ term deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ atem@@ ia Syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must get ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as associated clinical conditions associated with so@@ dium retention and oil formation . &quot;
&quot; as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous dosing of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed maturity of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve injuries in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk by humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at 56 % of patients came at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms include the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound which con@@ ju@@ gates with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ ting excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ ruptions in the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that the so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in new@@ born babies was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analogue within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative routes of nit@@ ric oxide ( so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ ate , so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ ate and so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possible substitu@@ tion of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated in liver and kid@@ neys enz@@ ym@@ atically with glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed . &quot;
&quot; concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined using a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rats were detected . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycle disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was detected no Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fast . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , repeated using so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral into three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion This medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosage of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nose @-@ probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early @-@ term deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ atem@@ ia Syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were subjected to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyram@@ idal cells of the brain @-@ thread . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for every gram taken nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ulate form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rats were detected . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , distur@@ ban@@ ces of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and a deterioration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you determine one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room in order to initiate a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stopping &quot; &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ aly measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent cl@@ utter ) , and additionally , they received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without offering of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except for severe ble@@ eding , where it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had ble@@ eding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervene or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; following the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before applying and the bol@@ us dose can be administered quickly intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate levels of kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ira vs. ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ oid should be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al compensation included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ bol@@ us without can adjustment at average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of in@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of mac@@ ular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against deer • active ble@@ eding or elevated blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of ble@@ eding in arter@@ ial punc@@ turing points occur in bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment in principle throughout ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after removal of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregates ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in combination with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters can be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; the animal experiments are inadequate with regard to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years were more common for adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe ble@@ edings were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with ha@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding or ble@@ eding in the punc@@ ture area , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known ble@@ eding point , re@@ operation due to ble@@ eding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed ble@@ eding locations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years were more common for adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately inter@@ rup@@ ed and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ al@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as the ani@@ onic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether it is tied to thro@@ mb@@ in in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ in s@@ nat@@ ches the binding of bic@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ira was unable to indu@@ ce a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past to indu@@ ce a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ ol@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by extending ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI has been performed in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ira should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
un@@ question@@ ned He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and ACS .
it is expected that bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide takes a cat@@ aboli@@ sm into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism which results from spl@@ itting the AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence through Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

&quot; type 2 diabetes , where the body can not be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin colli@@ sion was observed after six months . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in the normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect the blood glu@@ cose level . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal muscles . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased glu@@ con@@ ic capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ c@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosing or dis@@ ruption of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict doctor &apos;s supervision and can make a change to the dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that can increase blood glu@@ cose levels and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzymes ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ y@@ ram@@ id , fi@@ bre@@ ads , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene and sul@@ phon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c an@@ emia regulation can be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ al ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk nor is it absorbed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; below are the adverse drug risks associated with clinical studies , group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ;

&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy will fail to constantly change the injection point inside the injection area , may result in a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or via intra@@ ven@@ ous dosing of glu@@ cose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ cose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glu@@ cose level ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin@@ sin the effect of action occurs faster and the time of operation is shorter than with normal insulin .
&quot; in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ tus arter@@ i@@ - tus showed a therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cose @-@ lowering effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin@@ sin has twice as fast effect as a normal insulin @-@ insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cose @-@ bearing effect approximately 2 hours earlier as a human insulin .
&quot; the data was obvious that in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin@@ sin 2 minutes before meal , a comparable post @-@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin@@ ess was obtained 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; after the start of the meal , insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin@@ ess is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as in the normal insulin analog , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to the normal insulin analog , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ loss in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ mal mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
