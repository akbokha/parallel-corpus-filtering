<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of Melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. Those thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a psychological illness, in which the patients have some periods of normal atmosphere alternating with periods of normal atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and the prevention of some episodes in patients who have been addressing the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the case of both diseases, the solution can be used to treat or use the melting tablets in patients, to which the swallowing of tablets causes difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be reduced, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears primarily as "partial agonist" for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the brain activity, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their reoccurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the reoccurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Halopidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recovery, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder leading to increased anxiety involving Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"when used to treat bipolar disorder, abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of some episodes in previously treated patients, and when it was administered additionally to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms of irritated disorder more effectively than placebo and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), Acathalie (drowsiness), trembling (drowsiness), bleaching (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes involved in the treatment with Aripiprazol were outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the quick check of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with some episodes of bipolar I disturbance, if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes associated with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"considering the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is a result of psychotic illnesses and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, conductive disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which are predisposed for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acceleried and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states that are associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidoid or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk estimations for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagic and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrein patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is recommended if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see paragraph 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar can reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common administration of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can can be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after applying the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose-height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 can be administered together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethmorphine / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused in reproduction studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not result in medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporal and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicseizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma exposure."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I-disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine dopamine and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT2a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptors."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in the dose of Aripiprazol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor-ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the Putamen."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenia with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms in comparison to placebo."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar I fault, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar I fault Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-idol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week 12 Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or semi-idol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the companion therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazol demonstrated against placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxidation of Aripiprazol; CYP3A4 is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolism on CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients there are no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>

<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and candidogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify particular dangers for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) at rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times of mean Steady-State-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actraphane was evaluated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"in the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks which indicates how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c spike suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the complete list can be found in the package supplement)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane weigh over the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">"in October 2002, the European Commission issued Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the launch of Actraphane in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">"pre-mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily, if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect."</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in the dosage."</seg>

<seg id="876">"some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin."</seg>

<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven helper or glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect starts within half an hour, the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of operation is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a faster or delayed resorption.</seg>

<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available."</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asterase in combination with erythromycin were not performed but could increase the plasma bar of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69times compared to the value observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without the simultaneous use of Fosamphenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or ductors of CYP3A4 can, if used together with avert, may lead to interactions."</seg>

<seg id="1987">"in a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma bar increased by about 86% (90% fidelity interval 82 to 89%)."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"as a result, the simultaneous delivery of awe with ritonavir along with these glucoccortikoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases of the plasma bar are expected at the same time with vastase."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"since plasma melt increases of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhudomite olysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Amprenavir."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"it is recommended for more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in the same time as Amprenavir (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">"therefore, aspirin may not be used together with oral bidazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time it is advisable to use generic midazolam with parenteral midazolam."</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors point to a possible rise in the plasma bars of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"when methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on obpiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"due to the low permeability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as the Amprenavir dose is to be adapted when Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"with simultaneous use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with ait, increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended."</seg>

<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"according to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the promotional potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EKG-effects of i.a. arranged palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasmaconcentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.3-90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"after intravenous dosing of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean average (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5 was measured."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"pharmacokinetic simulations suggest that at once daily intravenous dosing of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), which was comparable to the intravenous administration of 0.75 mg measured. however, the Cmax was higher after the one-off of 0.75 mg higher."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"about 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in vitro studies on metabolism, CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2642">"Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"following a unique intravenous fisher injection in healthy eyes, the total body size was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"although patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the terminal eliminations time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposure, which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 preclinical trials suggest that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of Palonosetron (each dose accounted for about the 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver cancers, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal drops) and skin tumors in rats but not mice."</seg>

<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissues) or infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed between 1 and 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweigh the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small laundations, scratches or sewn wounds."</seg>

<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugars) in the blood or can not process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lysine is slightly different from insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter active life than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"type 2 diabetes, where the body can not be effectively processed, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
