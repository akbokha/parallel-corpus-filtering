the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Options ... Open the card map tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on extras crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or the list of crashes if present . &quot;
the view filter module ( also known as folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; size is the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . hence , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the tre@@ emap file represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the picture of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can define whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area is to be used by subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles ( whereby , therefore , the relative position of the labels can be set in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of performance algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be comp@@ lied with . it will be drawn to indicate that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is up to the lab@@ eling and avo@@ idance of space losses through frames always favour@@ ably to divide the areas that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can design@@ ate the minimum displayed area for an entry through the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent dialog to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind application .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or by Ctrl ; I .
&quot; when you access the picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can define the image &apos;s image . &quot;
the Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line option has a slider and a turn@@ table to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box file name of the image , you determine whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown in the gallery using the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , you determine if the file size is shown in the gallery in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the picture size check box , you determine if the size of the images is shown in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the Di@@ alogue Fol@@ der , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set with a scroll bar or a turn@@ table to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the check box of original pictures , you determine whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the check box Comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras / HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
changing browser identi@@ fier adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; adding the browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the default browser ID of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
&quot; change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for sites that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser ID to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identi@@ fier of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser ID is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can adjust the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ tization ; together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ous ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of end users . they should therefore report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; when you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; then we would like to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ In this mailing list , however , you should speak English , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ;
&quot; the best way to get involved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to participate , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . just enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all the image folders . &quot;
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will also be used as an alpha library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
&quot; if you already have a collection of images on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing pictures , as the base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ za ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless there is i@@ ste in hidden folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ low@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change it by using any photo from the album and use it on the folder icon . see the Albums tab for more details . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can edit &amp; edit your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the help menu resource support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Decoder Options and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ tization ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission .
&quot; the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is meanwhile outdated . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . the Exif support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plugins interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or move in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctrl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images functions anywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree tree , over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common ones : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter will only be used for the fields indicated in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this ind it is also shown . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the preferences . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; puts an organized view on your photo albums . all the photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed are sorted in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the properties of the album or after the date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import Images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Import screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse over the target album and drop it there . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed by a common name . the collection is used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete new collections by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album Date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
&quot; the El@@ ders El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Test@@ ers : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or that of the album &apos;s average . to this end , the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information will be used . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first have an album in &amp; edited , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is meant to help you remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; Select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a bit while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this , in which you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each picture will be shown below the corresponding preview . what information these are , you can edit by clicking Edit . select the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important properties including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section introduction in the main window shows such help window .
&quot; photos are all about digi@@ ti@@ sed . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to this . you can choose between viewing images , slide show or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... Select . in the Edit section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . for this , and how to adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete F@@ 8 image delete or Del if you prefer to er@@ ase , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My data list ; organizes your photos by means of the data . &amp; edited ; using either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos selected with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; to fold , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; &quot; ; or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; quot ; change .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; &quot; ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can click on the thumb@@ nail to view the images and select keywords from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the keyword menu Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
&quot; the time beam view shows a temporal , adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved across this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame you just need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . this displays all related images in the main window . &quot;
in the bottom panel you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ ul@@ er Search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search hits hits . if you click on this the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection according to your search , you just need to select the appropriate entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select a search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as an advanced search , the dialog for advanced search will appear in order to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select to delete the search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are displayed by operators separated , listed . an option can be added to this list with keywords / search group , or deleted from it . additionally , you can create this list with search group / search group . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; it allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar one . using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; finds the suitable images . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your images ge@@ o data .
in the bottom panel you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&quot; it works with all supported image file formats , including rough files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl ; L D@@ em light@@ box added from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right part of the window . if you select preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the images , you can also compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a series of images . if you use pairs of images from the toolbar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the right pane . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light desk like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it possible for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can spot on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you have to click them and press the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
zoom slider under the pictures or Ctrl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you preview in the mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process of following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos will result in a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , sharing , group@@ ing , backup , backup , archive , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ or@@ ised , sec@@ ures , seeks , assem@@ bles , conf@@ ection@@ ates and exports content that hab@@ an@@ .@@ quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information on or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use without inventory management to find a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; . the approach to store metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
&quot; holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements , e.g. version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend that metadata saves metadata in &amp; digi@@ p@@ ated ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? add &amp; edit ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . it makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos when you work . &quot;
&quot; let us now with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keyword will be edited by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata overl@@ aps . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panoramic view . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it , you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about . &quot;
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a label . you can even set it for a selection of images . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels are exported to your desires in let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system . &quot;
&quot; do you remember the times before the GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already driving with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already un@@ coun@@ table and will be deep@@ ening in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can repeat your journeys by using images with geographic indications . you can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Google Earth . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all amended versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , for example to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the work title of the photographer . examples of this may be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent professional photographer . since this is a mem@@ ue to the author &apos;s field , it must also be completed . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify them in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk failure , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ Track , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality for longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recorder devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media with a description , date &amp; author and then copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers of manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks stay longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperatures , the error rate increases dramatically . some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors indicate the im@@ min@@ ent failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause a locked @-@ up key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so , protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ idable result that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum protection . you should also pay attention to protect against flash damage and thus protect the correctly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that even all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ break power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and run the system . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its safety with the costs to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are very expensive compared to hard drives - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general f@@ use solution . &quot;
&quot; pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality only . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ aster @-@ proof . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transm@@ issions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss , since they produce inter@@ s@@ lic@@ ences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem , which is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of workplace systems . not@@ ebooks are already the share of th@@ ef@@ ts 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open Source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical fron@@ tiers . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss . so , you often make up your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or res@@ izing disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash fails you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget about aircraft disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference f@@ use : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : one of the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup is made . this backup comes with an version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and un@@ interrupted .
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh . &quot;
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach lets you get enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable images survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate it while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to be considered a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less versions you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have plan@@ ed the scal@@ ability and enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g to see if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / dev / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ db / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the disk if necessary &quot;
&quot; open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . however , it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can save gam@@ ma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
&quot; TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FL@@ ATE ) . it manages images in high quality , but needs very large files . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems .
&quot; this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &amp; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the format of raw format . X@@ MP fits in because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , there may be problems in connection between the metadata file and the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of application and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include work on architecture and modeling , discussion and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera editing , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again and edited , then you should add the metadata again . these were edited by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. in the section adding a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , connect it to your computer , connect the camera to the display mode , and switch it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. will appear on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . &quot;
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the Met@@ adata Editor displays the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s comment , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; edited ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods by &amp; click . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and download Sel@@ ected . the button Select is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you choose to download or download the chosen ones , a dialog box with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you chose the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select them first and then delete Sel@@ ected Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ ous ; they should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you load photos from different recording studios to the same album . therefore it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made to the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically each day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the relevant entries are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want another date format than standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do this , turn the option date &amp; time . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and used automatically once you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the end point of recording to perform automatic shooting during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic turning is usually turned on , and when your camera does not provide this information , it lets you unlock the photo ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off automatic turning , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic turning in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ ous ; use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case it will save &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the photos are directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to disable this option . use the Advanced button to select the Date based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; when the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ tha ; you , where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and click OK to start uploading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European G@@ AL@@ I@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers might be interesting to associate a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forget where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ o mapping ( manual ) and finally via the manual input of known locations . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as map module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ geographical module . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the preview of ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tries to give you so much control over its operations as you can . there are many settings that edit &amp; edit the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ In order to access these settings , you need to change from the Edit menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot;
select action can be set to preview or start image editing . you lay the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main screen .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . this can be descriptions such as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the photo you offer . this does not have to be the author , if it is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that has the image available will be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that metadata is permanently in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without lost .
&quot; save image cap@@ tions as embedded labelling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in images . this way , your cap@@ tions can also be read by other picture viewers . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the cursor in the main window rests over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to indicate , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in any file has been edited by &amp; digi@@ ous ; ignored . &quot;
default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the indicator by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can be set on this page on the default values . each time you open the light table , these settings should be turned on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TIFF file option , you can un@@ comp@@ ress the DE@@ FL@@ ATE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality since the DE@@ FL@@ ATE algorithm works without loss . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ ha@@ ired setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixel of the CCD sensor react with more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels on odd lines , this difference causes a minimum loss of details . this option exc@@ els the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic Colour Balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed star , so the parts of your images are burned in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the pointed white in the settings . the setting colors dis@@ solve some unusual results as it indicates the top lights in various pink tones . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels generally do not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Rec@@ on@@ ation option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 , but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing . to keep the time for de@@ colon@@ isation small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w offers three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks like that . as ob A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) , the first algorithm was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue corrections here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction , as it is done during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other are to be translated to allow the colors to be as exact as possible .
&quot; if an image is opened in the image processing , it will start color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; drag here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , which do not have color @-@ ton@@ mouse or gam@@ ma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gam@@ ma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . &quot;
&quot; there are other options , such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print out image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this might be manually adjusted rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you know the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a set of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
short@@ cuts for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the metadata to or from which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera features are shown on the left side a list of all cameras currently supported . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you will need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and switch it on . &quot;
&quot; check out whether &amp; digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; apply , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button Chang@@ es . &quot;
you can also display the greeting screen from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed while starting . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process from &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ous ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you , if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; to create , find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
you can use them to view your photos and edit and upgrade . the editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / editing .
&quot; the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; therefore , they may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the upper edge , including the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly needed functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing are changing your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or Save the Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File menu or the button &quot; &quot; Rec@@ over the Image Processing &quot; &quot; button in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have taken to the photo since the last save . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of the image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can undo , by selecting Edit Ret@@ ri@@ eval or restoring , by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should remember the short@@ cut , Ctrl ; -@@ Z for undo and Ctrl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; through the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom in by using Ctrl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the Edit menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : choose the magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the creation dialog by &amp; digi@@ tha ; you can view this from the Edit window ; see the main window for setting up image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print several images or whole sets . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print job from the menu album . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation arrows , also available in the image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab allow the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
&quot; in the label view , you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut according to 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling box in other applications , you should observe these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the labels are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata to the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ tation . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctrl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the keywords used previously . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is a further simpli@@ fication in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the keyword filter indicates no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with Str@@ g + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled in Settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule created and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string specified in the database . &quot;
you can e.g. set an Exten@@ ded Search for all elements of the database using the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ ous ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow , the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable vari@@ ance from the actual photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color management workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and which correspond to the colors you print or publish on the Web that correspond to your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results he would like . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition to you , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow complies with all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other picture editions are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped area , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent page and click on Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to install my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must calibr@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB is running on s@@ RGB . if you are working as RGB @-@ standard , you need to install either your monitor onto the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automati@@ cally Del@@ ete and Con@@ tr@@ ast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction try automatically from your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the brightness depth factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . thus , nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels . sometimes , the same very good results are achieved in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ ises the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light fron@@ ts and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete history of the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
contrast enhancement : this method improves contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a restart of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a colour space with 8 @-@ bit pro colour . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode , which operates in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be improved . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image as well as the preview of the target image are to be seen . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed . you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings may also be displayed as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles . it uses the modification and as@@ signing color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found in the chapter color management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously to allow you to use it for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the tone correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure exer@@ ted a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot;
&quot; intensity control the solar ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is possible chem@@ ically . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colors brilliant and glow . try it , it em@@ belli@@ shed lots of photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot , and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . &quot;
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the re@@ peti@@ tions re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . with large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you do a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is based on sound correction for improving exposure . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked and moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controls and make sure the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear viewing is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic distribution is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lower for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used as a background while something else is to be seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to this end , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ cators option monitors all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will only see the effect in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic views . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most useful . in this case , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a part panel to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and that the related pixels become dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the g@@ im@@ p curve format .
&quot; check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ cators option monitors all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ale channel . shade and sun shades have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to enhance color channels or to change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel mixer of image editing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first notice how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ anz , the image will retain the general brightness as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . color space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing color space first . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ cators option monitors all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you will only see the effect in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been reis@@ su@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating for your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography Black / White is a work step since color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good for all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
rot@@ ator : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic weather effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day .
yellow filter : simulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ ous tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a painting or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed below ( 2 ) . the Relief Parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Add mold frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer inside the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ching eye . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ching eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired type of frame for your image . complete the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce edges it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative features a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tools template can apply a template over a picture .
the menu image template use in image editing can be used to lay sten@@ cils on a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) for comp@@ iling the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil to the file size , just send an email in English to digi@@ ti@@ sed ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ tha @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder to the dialog box in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the templates of templates . &quot;
there are three buttons that allow you to change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ ink : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the full picture , you need to make the image smaller . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : move this button to move the image below the template .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture more shar@@ per . in fact , it doesn &apos;t matter a bit , it works rather psych@@ otrop@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a point of view . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour pixels are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more subsequently shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; with JPEG images , a camera often has been used internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already while reading the image . if you disable them , you get control over your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . this can be called with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ting shar@@ pen@@ ing .
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve more information and comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tly and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter fu@@ zzy mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried out first . an increase in radius or the amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ aten in the vicinity of sharp edges will generate . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore images should be best shar@@ pen@@ ed in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference . one can thereby define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft transition between the tones are avoided with shar@@ pen@@ ing , thus avoiding beauty defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example for the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image is the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ ission @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vien@@ nese filtering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur@@ red mask .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,1 are only rarely helpful . &quot;
&quot; if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also need to increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ ate sharp@@ ness . &quot;
the Save as and Load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try out all tri@@ mming , color and intensity gra@@ dients on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later left unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ ks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could cause bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ king to use a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ king always must create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it is never possible to remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vien@@ nese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . the FI@@ R Vien@@ nese filter is often better for processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed color picture needs to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the smooth@@ ie regul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of the area of the dark@@ ened , so as to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; ink tin@@ ts allow an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ riv@@ alled art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed retention p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.9 should be kept in a uniform way . a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary retro@@ actively . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film gr@@ itt or CCD ru@@ gs will generate a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it needs to be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is passed . usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angular step@@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long runtime . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you get by choosing this option is only low , but it doubles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to ski@@ p it . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . to correct any setting of image errors , it can be saved in a text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button . &quot;
the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer obtain and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : control edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ ma oler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas which are typically smo@@ ky and also lubric@@ ated the shadow areas .
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges will appear smooth when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
saving and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how room reduction can change your life . the original image is lab@@ elled with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tly and experiment with the smooth@@ ie . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove the pal@@ ate , film bas@@ tion , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a low @-@ loss compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ e@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie gran@@ ulation on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo which was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; that &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ pixels allowed Hot@@ pixels from photos that were taken with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; light , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , since many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and quot ; bright pixel quot ; to remove on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the button dark picture . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark picture to the image to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all previous areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : there is an average of the neighbouring pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , under@@ exposed facets , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shad@@ ed ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which allows the necessary closure time to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects arise through motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure zones of today &apos;s filters and the color or gray scale series of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was made without this filter . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the vig@@ nette correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light strengthening at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , un@@ fold it to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ nette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls provide only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er reset of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ nette correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; len@@ tic@@ ular distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fla@@ p at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second gra@@ der . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion Second Gra@@ des . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values are cor@@ p@@ ted distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter generally . &quot;
zoom : this value scales the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the spher@@ ical correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best do this correction than the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then carry out a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the groove . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cor@@ p@@ se distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ form tri@@ mming from image editing or via the zoom slider of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frames and paintings it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 i@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters to set film bas@@ kets and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option F@@ erry movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO slider changes the amount of film gran@@ ular@@ ity and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
&quot; since the filter mix@@ es color channels to reproduce infr@@ a @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter tray applied to a landscape photograph of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter film bas@@ tion is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the image quality effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photo , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large images . smooth , controlled the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hing@@ es . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the re@@ working is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . the lines , which define the outline in drawing , are highlighted . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . &quot;
there are two kno@@ bs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjusting the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity values .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter Grav@@ ur shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ astic landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the painted image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of gl@@ ass@@ blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur@@ red effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom : wi@@ pes the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ om@@ izing camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance un@@ shar@@ pen@@ di@@ cular : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera . &quot;
this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits and gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image through random displacement of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the image and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value .
&quot; some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
rain@@ drops are a nice small tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of drops in the image .
&quot; you can do with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . &quot;
photo infl@@ ate is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ers size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ate was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below :
&quot; maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it needs to be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . magni@@ fying each single click for photo can be saved as text file , and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; infl@@ ate photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear expansion of the standard .
&quot; cutting a picture is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows this very simple . to cut a photo , you simply need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle creates it by simply pressing the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctrl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly cro@@ pped photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview pane , you can change the rect@@ angle size by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can indicate the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the landscape format will always be assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ eters , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically focus the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can bet with the Max . ratio button the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are saved in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the tri@@ mm@@ ed image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the inter@@ locking help make it possible to hide help , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ level rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden mean is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which used to design your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden mean provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will provide you with good results for your photos . in comparison to the third @-@ level rule the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ il@@ ateral tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can make a static object dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of the dynamic symmet@@ ry called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently . &quot;
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the color button , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy for you to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . &quot;
rotate your image with a slide angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after turning a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the transforming Zu@@ mming function from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to crop the image is the automatic cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option fl@@ atten the image a bit after the turn . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit lubric@@ ated . for individual adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after which you adapted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the top part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . &quot;
&quot; draw your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can shi@@ mmer horizont@@ ally and vertically . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit wi@@ ped . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two loops generate twice as much knowledge and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , of how these libraries are comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system here . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the expansion is listed in the list , it will be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the file extensions will be edited by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; see the Configuration section for more information on this . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful instructions in English on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ za ; support the loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all supported cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of formats supported by &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported by : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the format or m@@ peg format ; however , these formats and will generate thumb@@ nails for the movies . if you click on a movie file , it does not have any built @-@ in capabilities to display or edit movies ; the &amp; gt ; settings for playback of movies to start playing . &quot;

&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be immediately updated . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Charac@@ ter@@ istics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are taken from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your images ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for palette files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be considered either for the entire system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and la@@ stly used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse folders by files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the palette view . here the color name can be changed .

&amp; Gra@@ ph ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphic ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ ene . &amp; Gra@@ phs ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; displays graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and represented in &amp; k@@ graphs ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; -@@ component to open
loading big graphs ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
&quot; additional software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list is opened . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
zoom in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphs ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings k@@ graphs ; ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; an instance or the loaded graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; during program start , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that are on a page will be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one graph divided on several pages without header and with another font
you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad re@@ charging or ignor@@ ing the changes ) or asking the program any time .
you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is required .
the session management page gives you the opportunity to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here , you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm determines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spring bed model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; fd@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm organis@@ es the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should print the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Algorith@@ ms special options , or even the graphs with a filter , before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of the graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to that element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools for displaying . it requires the following packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ colour palette and the grid , in which you draw the icon . &quot;
&quot; a new icon creates a new icon . if the current file is changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon is to be created from a template , or if you want to start anew from scratch . &quot;
&quot; reco@@ vers the last und@@ one step back . if you do not make any step undo , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board has a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not correspond with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ; .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the point you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board has a symbol ) .
&quot; open a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; using buttons add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel Insert or Lin@@ e@@ ale and insert in @-@ color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparent display . you can also adjust for the ch@@ ess@@ board the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
reading the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the SAN@@ E project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ t@@ he own to select your image . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button Scan to read the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure the window will be displayed as some settings will not be shown otherwise .
&quot; after you have scann@@ ed the button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the image file will appear . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . you also need to specify the compression and type of the image file . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
you can create screen shots after you have selected in the menu Import &gt; Screen photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen Phot@@ om@@ odes :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen shot has been created , the Di@@ alogue Options dialog appears with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can easily select the albums you want to archive . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . the Auto@@ Play option is also available for Windows platforms .
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program where you are loaded to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you like within the calling program . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I Module Double images search is a tool to search for dup@@ licate images in your picture collection .
the K@@ IP@@ I module has currently no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
Flickr is an online photo management on the internet . with Flickr it is possible to show its photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the export module to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for authentication . it is therefore virtually your cre@@ denti@@ al to Flickr . a browser is started to allow you to login on Flickr . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; just close the browser window and return to the program . after you click Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module exports to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access author@@ is@@ ations which indicates the module . at present , you will need any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press on the O@@ k button , you can start uploading the photos to the Flickr server . &quot;
the keyword field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with Options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the permissions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos in front of the upload , the photos are changed before uploading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at the maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size will be changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keyword and loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width rati@@ os are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ h can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . in order to get a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alisation , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the top deviation of the GPS time and camera conditions . if the deviation is below the data the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in min. can be used if you have no appropriate data . if you know that there is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relative to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge it , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can choose the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML . they do not need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Reiter album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . to do this , select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ exports that contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . hit Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during production . the web browser will be automatically launched at the end to display the preview of the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and ma@@ sts . it has been designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed as default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found in PNG format e.g. . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the Met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please see hex@@ id@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Enco@@ der Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ ders module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all pictures are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can start using Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au to start the module . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the content of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set in the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all your preferences , you can start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets via the Settings button at the bottom of the page . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to enhance or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your RAW files stored in RAW formats to one of three formats of JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
&quot; first , select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Preview button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches no effect . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are pleased with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information in your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later use it , you should not select the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; batch conversion mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the option to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 dim . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . using the Add Photos button , you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right side . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after selecting all the images , click OK to open the new message window of your email client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select will be attached as app@@ endix . &quot;
make sure not to send many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it might be a good idea to send more mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the comments in an attached file , the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and the mail was attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in the file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is done , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like you want your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option will show that the fil@@ ename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then manually start with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly make sure that the images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be the order of the images in the album .
&quot; with delay between images , the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect during each transition between images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse over this corner to switch on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar , you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous image and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has currently no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have completed your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both people are shown . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of pictures displayed from a few thousand images to a few more images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your activity area . &quot;
&quot; in the image , each person has the same icon in front of their name . they can store an own thumb@@ nail for each person , which is of course also true for places , keywords and other categories you defined by yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the names , select the button that is located right outside on the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up menu you can select which view you can use for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must select which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu . now , you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you call the listing in the main window , you will see a dialog showing the dialog for setting the image properties very similar . you can see this dialog again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string of characters in the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can search all the pictures according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but prefer to try out the same functionality , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; j@@ photo@@ album ; and choose the demo in the first dialog , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry for photo@@ album ; start demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name implies , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries Preview pane from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select an area , you &apos;ll see only images of this period in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create html websites with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual it is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version that you can create via the HTML menu ...
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each area will be described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages , you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file is to be created which is shown on the overview page . you can find more information about the export files in . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed which are visible to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are of a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically discussed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . so , it can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really all are visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described just have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in a double way . first , it scans the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the relevant images are not found , the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files are scann@@ ed . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for exporting images will be described , which you can export via the File menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices available :
&quot; with the Man@@ ually option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automati@@ cally copied to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this anyway , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is supposed to be 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported data base as described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folders the imported images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are person@@ er to the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will see the different steps of ( 1 ) setting the information on your pictures , via ( 2 ) the browsing and view , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual there is talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .@@ x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup to a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and automatically re @-@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , you can start a different folder tree with images , you can use the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Picture / index@@ .@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry settings for photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can preview settings and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described how to define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of one member as explained in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; this module system is K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . for more information , please visit the website of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; are , but separately driven . however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications using the modules above K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it may be that some modules do not work with &amp; photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications use their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . &quot;
&quot; simulated &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category persons , you will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , whether you have chosen persons to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you will see the window in which you can browse your image database . at the moment , you will see the window that you have entered into your image database . in the section , we will return to this window , but now click on the entry picture to show you an overview with all existing pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the ability to display any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the image , etc . you can use any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text field by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on the shifting of the images within the list : if , for example , have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , in this way , that the used names are moved up to find people faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click on the thumb@@ nail and back buttons that are under the preview of the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; the image shows a browser window that displays the USA as an over@@ load . to show you that it is an over@@ load group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the dialog box it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the dialog by clicking the bar , which form the top of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by dra@@ gging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which gives you , among other things , the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also remove a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options ... and then remove window / hide . this process is shown in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you do not open a window with an image viewer , a new window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the respective images from which you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without having to store them on the hard drive . of course , you must have the images stored somewhere , so that &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files out of the folders and copy them back again . if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid dup@@ lic@@ ating your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the Images menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those remaining you want to see for others and click on current view lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister can see , control and lock everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; in this way , you have specified which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to block pictures , thereby hiding all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password , which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ enco@@ ded text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is , of course , that you want to consider it sometime . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . this allows you to start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer inside . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have to have about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ clicking on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image above and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus . started and stopped the slideshow by pressing Ctrl ; S . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer you can enter the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the same key , zoom the zoom so that each pixel matches one pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the single zoom sur@@ geri@@ es that work with videos that come in and out with the plus and minus key are .
&quot; with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make ann@@ ot@@ ations to the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . in the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name , but you might prefer to highlight the image and view more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to furnis@@ h images with features while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letter . in see a picture where features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly features can be displayed in preview View . if you want to display categories in dre Th@@ umb@@ nail , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image was selected . &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the ch@@ ime is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to view the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray should be read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed yellow in the wire model views .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
del@@ eting either from the Edit menu or from the right mouse button context menu allows you to remove selected objects from the scene previously .
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click on App@@ ly or reject the changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; click preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a subordin@@ ate element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Visi@@ bility Level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected , or the level of visibility of the scene selected in the toolbar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another order , you can set it in as desired . you can also store multiple windows order and switch between different set@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; to create a window above or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over one another , drag the p@@ ale in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map @-@ card riders at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter onto the desktop or click on the small arrow at the upper left pointing arrow in the fas@@ cia strip . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with window arrangement . it displays a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the Ren@@ ders icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a fast preview to full @-@ quality pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The render settings in the toolbar or in the View menu of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each rendering mode has a name . you can enter any name , meaning it is a name that lets you know the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the picture section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties , which &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixels with inputs . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively , because each pixel is distributed over and over again and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sive depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray is pursuing a beam per pixel . if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels is scann@@ ed with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be comp@@ uted , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually pursued and checked for further division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion allows you to adjust with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch to J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be comp@@ uted through POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit any object .

&quot; to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects to the scene , simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with Copy and Pa@@ ste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert source for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file exists in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object pick @-@ up of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid seper@@ ately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you tick high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach for the projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; if you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick bit@@ rate smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window en@@ closures section , explains how to create and store window arrangements . &quot;
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with map card you get a map card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any further knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all the steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed all error @-@ free , see the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . now you have a scene without objects .
this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the App@@ ly or Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could set a cube ( inser@@ ting end bodies qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an easy way to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : choose the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited ending level . when you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and displacement . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to an exercise under the horizon , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = base pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button Preview see how the pigment is now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pre@@ viewing of the pigment will only show a matt black material , because you have to check the pig@@ ments settings at any time . so , always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the qu@@ ader and the ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to do this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball would float above the floor , since you have moved the bottom to a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the bottom , give the sphere a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; first select sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some Finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the gloss effects and reflection results in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ sourcing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender will calculate the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog can affect . thus , the scene is processed pixel for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved saved changes in the scene .
&quot; repeat the last returned command . you can only select this menu entry , if you have used Edi@@ ting undo . &quot;
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pres@@ et short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to prevent rough surfaces without having to model any hi@@ ves on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
&quot; basic elements are simple geometric shapes , which can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart .
&quot; the application has a file browser , where you can select images for displaying . &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a particular file , just type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right bottom . if a matching fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the Configuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , there are five cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background color , which you can set further down . pres@@ et@@ ting is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; while moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start will open &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ball show , so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program as well . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to zero , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub @-@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;

&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
exposure indicators allow you to select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display color with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer does as images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer does as images to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set in the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then select scanning area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the full preview in the window . &quot;
&quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; if before saving a preview is displayed in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a break and you get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog to save for each picture opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a fil@@ ename . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically saving images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a numerical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button Over launches the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings dialog displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs short@@ cuts . below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function .
you may set up your multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short@@ cuts work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could look like : &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok additionally has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give a feedback to the user if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos;@@ Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should include any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this is usually used by the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Switch the script to display the setup dialog . in order to store and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume Sign@@ al@@ ises a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title @-@ Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ title are also passed to allow the script to remove the cli@@ cked record . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. , saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be zi@@ pped with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should correctly name your script packages correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining memory modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can hang it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you &apos;ll find just a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you shouldn &apos;t have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , it has some options that you can activate or de@@ activate at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iler options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . for details see the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; enable debu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty over the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; displays the player window in addition to the playlist , or if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; disc@@ ard voice files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
&quot; other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok , use relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece of the piece change , it causes the playlist window to appear / rol@@ les to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when switching to the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust the appearance &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the Fon@@ ts section you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using custom fonts , the otherwise gray represented section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define its own color scheme . use the color selection activated among them for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the playback continues automatically with the piece at the place , with which it stopped at the last comm@@ itting . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen display allows you to set up the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadows that the text in the O@@ SD is displayed .
&quot; use your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colours for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if your color is not activated , the default colors will be used . &quot;
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the Screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers activate even more setting options in this card map .
the card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders that &amp; Amar@@ ok , search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting out how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders can be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
&quot; import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok , adds all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser . &quot;
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : the machine is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username and password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
sending played pieces and updating the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; note : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok , get a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can see the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs therefore installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager reads the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ lib library for days . you can see the file locate file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and let it create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , it is because Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a information from this file system crashes . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature . &quot;
&quot; ensure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this causes crashes when editing Met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic . disable , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically when you crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) will always be active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ lim@@ ating Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
you can also find help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ zilla is not suitable for help . please enter only a mistake there , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come into place ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the user interface intuitive , the start window into the statistics window has been converted . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the Quick commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select from Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s that simple : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the button playlist is located . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that really is true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder can be supplied with the pres@@ et ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , input key &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously . this can be done by a sound card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( for example , os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS converts the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real@@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( x@@ ine driver was highly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less straps react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask for the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with the recent config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the register register again . &quot;
&quot; if you have a list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . in addition the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time . &quot;
how can you know the current status in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if there is a functioning SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ Vo@@ d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ User name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of Ctrl + Right mouse button places a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages . &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this adap@@ ts the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can select the rating for a piece by yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . there , you can change the valuation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select rating or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Met@@ adata dialog . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan , which is not compatible with the short term established plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings Tool Typ@@ es ... and take the required changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click on New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid trouble , it was removed . &quot;
kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Con@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ o@@ ok .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ ac@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ ac@@ bler is entirely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install it .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; presum@@ ably , use a distribution which will install the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you have to install the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . after that , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message there is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must also be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok again . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with arts will not be cared for . you can of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can get the new so much needed advisor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there are the setup wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or the wizard just don &apos;t like , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , then you can save it using the button playlist , and you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; when you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , you can already see these play@@ lists in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select an audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD tracks in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Burn function can also be found in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the Burn menu . you will have different options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make more enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions .
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below is the range , the game time , bit@@ rate and sampling rate of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; the player window also includes a selection of audio @-@ analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the pane . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included . the PL button activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ Q . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and play position sli@@ ders . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check@@ box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , let &apos;s not frigh@@ ten you from the wealth of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the sub@@ window will fall away . the information presented there are now distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below , you can see the cover picture of the album and a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you &apos;ll see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; to view cover images in the context browser , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferred . the context browser will also display cover pictures that are either downloaded with the Cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ eces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played right away . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , Albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be un@@ folded and you will see the album &apos;s content . &quot;
you can click on any of the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded lyrics will be displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is still running , you can choose which to run . &quot;
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the changed version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is necessary .
the Search button opens a search to google.com according to the text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter / album - First of all , the pieces will be arranged according to the interpreter and this is the best view of your collection . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different performers . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Performer / year - album - sorted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are shown alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are sorted first by genre and among them by interpreter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the playlist section in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection panel with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - this cle@@ ans the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order .
attach to Play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; on Media Player - Insert the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This is why the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown . &quot;
edit Met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selection - Mark@@ s the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among different performers . &quot;
&quot; the album will no longer be shown under different performers , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes handling of many play@@ lists quite easy . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter , sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will end the pieces on your iPod . when the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive attachment for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not correspond to your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z enter and press Enter , you can play music in the music file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the hanging of files can be difficult . in this case the holding of the Shift key may be helpful . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter the letters , only the pieces are displayed which contain the letters . in order to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , it will search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces are found which contain one or two or three ( or combination thereof ) .
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the order sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left side , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar it is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback rolls and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on menu and set up toolbar buttons ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Management is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures . you can start them by selecting actions Cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the Cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the order appears in the playlist next to the title . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece in the playlist , then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . then you can change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( details of setting up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ Recommen@@ dations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist .
&quot; double click the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pres@@ et modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists recommended pieces start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the latest possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again . &quot;
the New button moves the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog for editing the playlist settings will open . &quot;
&quot; enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be over and they will not hear twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under consideration of the setting played pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces played , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continually , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right @-@ hand side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok , will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on Configuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a dialog box where a script package will be installed . once you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section writing Script . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plugins will be used to enable the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is to show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that when renew@@ ing MP3 , you will get a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a loss@@ less format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is to show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD@@ ROM ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copying process . as soon as reading the original is finished in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD @-@ medium to which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; typically automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality at burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a perfectly open pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis prof@@ es from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 2 decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , allowing you to read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ q@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to burn them to an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio Enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; Norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file saving .
&quot; when a project changes and has not been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can break the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any saved project what to do with it as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is it ? help ( available via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you select files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; this also allows without project file copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . you should prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this also allows without project file copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so that the content will be deleted completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
&quot; the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then immediately be burned by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be instantly burned by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously read DVD video can be converted . this dialog usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all @-@ in . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and dis@@ closing the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow section , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the other views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after choosing one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general application settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is meant for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . by means of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled for example using a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P features , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so rather your taste and the type of your task will be crucial , which of the programs you provide . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ writing , format DVD , and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void er@@ ase@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Tor@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String MP ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( Q@@ String ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String ) void get@@ rul@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) void &quot; void &quot; void &quot;
&quot; with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folders : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cream cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , quite simply audio CD ; s can be read out and saved in MP3 or OGG files . also other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ vers , which enco@@ des these WAV files ( compres@@ sing ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to coding , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device the protection goes , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the Setup di@@ alogs tab - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of encoder options so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the standard . it must be noted that before the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main creation dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Enco@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here , you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rati@@ os and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , which lose information through data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play@@ sets exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the Free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it is important to note that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( note of the translation : this is meant by the author ) . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be hurt . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for using Free@@ DB , it may be used with another ( fake ) address used in the system . in this type of configuration , it does not use the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for using Free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to do it , looking at the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. Please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the read WAV files , the encoding and thus the desired file format can be selected . when opening , there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself . &quot;
&quot; the encoding package must be installed from the Linux distribution , before the encoding can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined encoding . for more information about co@@ Di@@ vers , refer to the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a code , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real on it , and whether c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; please check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame may be found with a search engine as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory is / usr / share / cd and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each output &amp; CD ;
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ ders to use for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we share the program using Free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them on any outside of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing applications of device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the Map General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be as p@@ ale / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when data for generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a Free@@ DB calcul@@ ator .
&quot; note : the computer must be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the Free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , you can easily change it . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ qu@@ ad &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and Free@@ DB will not be used . however , you can use Free@@ DB locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , the two selection boxes need to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following board map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is Free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the Free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this path , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as far as the server concerns , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ ck@@ le the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there is perhaps more luck with protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the Free@@ DB server . de@@ activate the first check box should be enough . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; simultaneous reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try it yourself . &quot;
CD ; ej@@ ecting after reading the last piece : tick this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be the path / folder in which the WAV files are saved . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget that folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be pu@@ zz@@ led to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is sufficient for very good audio quality even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression coefficient is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , which is organized on the hard drive . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , has been described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ DB will need to pick up . the process that is described in this section needs to be repeated for each remote &amp; CD ; it must be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we are using a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in Free@@ DB , the screen@@ shots show a bit different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually input data , rather than picking them out of the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not been done yet , the &amp; CD now has to be pushed into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , look in the questions and answers to the help section or go back to the previous section on the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched by the Free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually initiate this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but the data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual commentary by the individual , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all tracks of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the Free@@ DB , the CD @-@ editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with upper case letter or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 Tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the drop @-@ down list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the button Selection has started reading the selection process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll have a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you when trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error oc@@ cured directly after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . thus , reading and coding are parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you will need the encoder of your choice . &quot;
&quot; most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that inv@@ okes many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any locking point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program start no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this probably has already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and if you are reading this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke Player by &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is required for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , K@@ Mid will start again the next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Cancel button on the toolbar , select the item playing from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ pos and then change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar is like a pressure on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song event and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected using a song so you don &apos;t need to manually adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the entries or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played after a series of MIDI files . in this section you &apos;ll see how to use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the beginning with the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the time in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatically added to the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ determined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the next song , next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow button on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US maps , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ ali@@ zations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as many times as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; the patch is meant to be a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ic instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to depic@@ t sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . watch as an example the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , make it easy in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is indicated in which ratio of pitch B@@ ender events will be multiplied . if so , a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ b@@ ender event with the value n , this will be converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ its in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends to play a keyboard that gets a pitch B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to an oc@@ ta@@ ve . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button no longer illumin@@ ates green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played notes . view the View menu under the View Channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo l@@ cd indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can run on two different devices with very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone to use k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that &apos;s because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s front@@ page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or when I want to play a file , just go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , switch the Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Málaga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much leisure time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge joy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact you ( if you want ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and by no means got money for it . I would therefore like to emphasize that I only need more programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the error that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians in the net giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search information and view images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you cannot hear any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of continuous playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you cli@@ cked an entry , his group and all his sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked record . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do it if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor from the View menu and next editing mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist to select the playlist and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without counting the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be powered by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation of starting and operating can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c and changing from &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ bler option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying during the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ ordin@@ . sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet , &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L which are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the data stream from the network and other things .
&quot; another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here , the output of m@@ player is visible . &quot;
&quot; there is no tab for this device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla is played : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even paste the special field embed for YouTube into the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file will be given by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual alter@@ ing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device must be used and the TV channels can be configured . &quot;
&quot; configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player is the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player only uses X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints about how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used to the packet &amp; tex@@ tual ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users do not need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact can be made via the k@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you want to compile it , please refer to the k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its ways the manual should be used to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .

&quot; here only a good sight to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to master correctly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 will be used . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the Fast entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also set some settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document to be created is defined : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; Newsletter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ rec@@ pr@@ t &#93; , film &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;

new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; when typing a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for example , \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be disabled . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ divided , the bottom element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; def@@ aul@@ ted file &#93; &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the available output by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the click search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked with the editor and once click on an element in the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked to the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document can be set over project project settings .
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; file is used on Ã ¢ n@@ der@@ s.@@ â &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast insertion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field Other is available for articles such as keywords , joint notes or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written naturally also in &amp; k@@ ile ; manually written by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for the definition of the font size . you can set the font for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size does not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or Kn@@ op@@ fs rapid construction . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for saving the storage automatically .
&quot; if the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( with environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the written comment 12 will be created and only a few swe@@ ets should have another written comment . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } want to su@@ e the possibility of obtaining the font name in the environment . &quot;
the changes are only covered within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { recommended } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is closed as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in one sentence can be recur@@ sively displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is displayed , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has been entered a bit of text , a few modifications should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in bold and ital@@ ics printing and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
once the document is viewed can be returned to the editor using editor view or Ctrl + ( for the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer the window must be closed .
&quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar allows conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the ad search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . just configure Modern under Settings ... Building Tools .
&quot; to enlarge the ad search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in a line of the source code and close to the ad search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer takes place then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document from &amp; k@@ ile ; opened and jump to the corresponding line . to do this you need &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( Set setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if using fast @-@ build the &amp; DVI ; viewer , there may be an error . if an error is present , this will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log file lists the error source in the source code . in the editor , the button @-@ like La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , it must be cli@@ cked to the error in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to choose the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can either be written from scratch or used for fast creation of a new document . for more information , please refer to the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates may be in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a new document using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can choose your own template instead of the default ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be carried out . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ate ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be used to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked for use La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
double click with but@@ ton@@ ed Ctrl key to choose the &amp; tex ; word . this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse and emphasize different types of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a separate type of bookmark within the text . the menu Edi@@ ting Jump@@ marks or the respective button zel allows the jump to the closest or last jump mark . thereby , this jump is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent features , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; use always many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selection , the following commands are included for text selection : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
select the word below the current cursor position . this option also has an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a packet ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to solve a part of the document , obviously it can be washed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides the key Ctrl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit selection paragraph .
&quot; it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under Edi@@ ting environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump@@ ed to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump@@ ed to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment . &quot;
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } will be jump@@ ed to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of ne@@ sted ambient commands , you can quickly get lost view afterwards . this command closes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not dis@@ rupted . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
&quot; with this command , jump@@ ed to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump@@ ed to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the polished cl@@ asp . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or behind the shar@@ pen@@ ed cl@@ asp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , it jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of ne@@ sted groups @-@ par@@ enth@@ eses , quick retri@@ eval can be lost . this command closes the most recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not dis@@ rupted . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple address signs are used as GÃ ¤ n@@ s@@ schen . for suitable implementation , the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; used for two simple quotation marks . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and fills two close quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic insertion of double quotes can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used with specific settings ( e.g. native german or french ) , and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when pressing Shift ; Enter key &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; k@@ ile ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , t &amp; k@@ ile closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an ending line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be configured in settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in table environments and thereby assign all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . if this tab@@ ulator is not the same , add &amp; ch@@ ile ; after the next tab in the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes work for automatic comprehen@@ sion . all of these modes can be set up for different working modes under settings K@@ ile ... complete . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the press button , the last character of the input will be removed and clearly gr@@ Ã ¼ n the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shr@@ ink by entering another letter . &quot;
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command .
settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; can be adjusted to these lists . you can choose different W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as expan@@ sions of general language use .
&quot; command mode is not necessary for full use of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to full @-@ fill mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for compl@@ ying environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the Full Mode over the Men@@ Ã ¼ Modi@@ fication Mode , or the key root Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient condition can be continued by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; real@@ ises that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; can be adjusted to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ list of full @-@ memory mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over Men@@ Ã ¼ Modi@@ fication or the key Ctrl + Alt key @-@ key , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ ller is not helpful for automatic complete failure . however , it has been noted that a lot of users are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile provides &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete termination for all already registered offices . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile can be disabled . here you can also set the threshold value for display of completion .
&quot; the finishing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the native home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog box shapes the design of graphics as simple as possible . to ensure the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be consider@@ d and consider@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all tools are group@@ ed together in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Create compile , create conversion and create view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard root Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by using Alt ; 4 using the DVI ; file to be viewed in a PS file , and 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick build command , normally a viewer is called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will open . &quot;
a new project will be launched on the Men@@ Ã ¼ Project New Project .... here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function from &amp; k@@ ile ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered by scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet non @-@ exist@@ ent and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first you must say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; will be supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; extra@@ di@@ ted , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application text doc@@ t@@ k , containing a database with all documents to &amp; k@@ ile ; included documents and here a graphical surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or search . by &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is a cross @-@ country and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be carried out on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continuation of the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ project and for many hours for the development of tools , which we all use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signatures , the same signature is taken from the signature file from &amp; k@@ sig . for each day , use different signatures for each day , as in the random signatures create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select Ctrl ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; blank signature ; in the Sig@@ natures . click the &amp; lt ; blank signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section . if you have entered your signature , save it by Ctrl ; S file Save or click on the flo@@ ppy icon Save . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you want . then you have a list of signatures for email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you &apos;re using emails privately or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then click Rem@@ ove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the User @-@ defined button on the bottom right , and enter the new cursor by pressing the key or key combination . &quot;

&quot; if it contains , then a new XP@@ ath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the cursor in the main window will be moved to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their involvement in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use Kom@@ mander as a surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive utilities . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation , knows me and how outstanding it is . if we still lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer clicks on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on and done the icon for the XML processor ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the popular working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; -@@ files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already mentioned , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation already worked , knows how useful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical surface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the tick in the current file and select the file to be checked by means of other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG validation is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this is using the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus will be selected , then just select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file sel@@ ector . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have a lot to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we start editing plugins . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all included plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze appears as expressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions performed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will insert a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
&quot; it can be either the comment entry from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where Nick@@ name of the introduced nick@@ name of the team member is to play a role in the project of the following possibilities : team manager sub@@ project manager , according to the area and sub@@ project managers , should be given the respective area or sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends across some pages that are treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically past@@ ed tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically past@@ ed attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
&quot; automatically closing optional tags : when checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , it is immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
&quot; not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end day automatically refresh : when enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
auto replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . restoring standard features can be restored using button Standard .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening files ( where encoding the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be changed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here will be affected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; create regular backup copies , so that during the next launch of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a board ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , preview and source text at the same time . &quot;
setting the default window settings to the default is useful when the user interface has been confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dra@@ gging views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
the alert noti@@ fier is used to control the display of war@@ nings by hooks of non @-@ queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL and the source text view in shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Struc@@ tural Adju@@ st@@ ment area , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep when changing the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be un@@ folded for multiple copies . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ b abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a stand@@ alone like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; loading a component in the &quot; &quot; read @-@ read &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is ref@@ using . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , select if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , debu@@ gging was completely new . instead , the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger was implemented , as well as support for the D@@ BG debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in dialog box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a debu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock . &quot;
a view showing the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger . normally appears in the lower D@@ ock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action is used to connect to debu@@ gger , if required , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug promp@@ ts . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened using a debu@@ gger so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or ends the noise according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to launch a debu@@ gging requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the debu@@ gger display .
&quot; tells the debu@@ gger to start running the script and send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if this happens before a de@@ bug request has been started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instru@@ cts debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , exec@@ uting the execution begins as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , whereby , if possible , it is corrected in functions and include . &quot;
tells the debu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs , and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting P@@ acks ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folders and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folders and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folders and the toolbar ( above the editing pane ) , the text and instructions more quickly in a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar buttons . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dialog for the tag . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . toolbar buttons enable fast inser@@ ting tags in a document without the risk of a write failure .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ der bear the name of description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML , declar@@ ing whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything else as a single element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has an ordinary attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is a single element type element .
&quot; this element can only be used once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is an only element type element . &quot;
specifies the source code used for filling for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ Name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the tag XML files , the Tools dialog is to start dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , checking only when loading the tag XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it to be reached via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be set with settings actions ... clicking New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the user @-@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut is removable . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the different see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter need to be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ sq@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; when an instance runs , the text will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be given to the default input . in the selective input field , input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected Text : the selected portion of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , are directed to the standard output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written on the standard output , by setting the value of the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create one own toolbar for each group . in given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan to use it , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; edit tag &quot; &quot; if available , so that entering the action is possible . &quot;
ignorance ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create an icon that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Visual Other Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , sti@@ ff , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will be inserted ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still which ones , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus features to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups .
&quot; after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by trying all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; back up in the right folders . after the new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c so that their toolbar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the Table of Contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files .
&quot; the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is indicated . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file and save it to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , are you not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places , there is an Email send menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with Email , send tool toolbar with Email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resource can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team considers them to be correct and useless for publication . to make a contribution , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when uploading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource you need to fill out the input field ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start uploading . &quot;
&quot; uploading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool slides , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in any day XML format might be necessary . there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; setting the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . from toolbar over actions , everything that is as global is saved in the shared folder structure by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to backup different tools , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool slides . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ beds the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of key areas : the editor window , the building views , the map filters with information and tool@@ bars . please refer to , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab@@ s with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all the tab@@ s , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS orders to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click on the editor area to a further context menu with regard to the edited documentation content , such as editing / past@@ ing / paste , editing the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , help to the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the toolbar buttons are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
&quot; the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert in your document , then click the icon that represents the Tag . now , you can fill the data for this just added day . if you want to insert the data for this just added day , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate and ro@@ am in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with card holders stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool called &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , uploading or del@@ eting files from storage media can be done with the then displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the relevant user and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the breakdown in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the introduction system , which is aligned to the content , allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( so there are ) in that window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool bar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the toolbar to a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems at startup of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a fast web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up Language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above requirement must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itting actions , scripts and tool slides , automation is possible . by means of the Kom@@ mander , they can expand them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . ( read more about it in . ) &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ encer @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the templates section . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters for &amp; HTML ; friction , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
converts the text from clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; friction which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script debu@@ ts error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
de@@ activation of the problem port at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded any other input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project management . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
&quot; dialog opens a dialog to add a new toolbar , which only creates the name . actions must be saved using the Settings dialog . toolbar buttons are saved using toolbar icons , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; remove a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send their own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team for the toolbar in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endix .
&quot; allows uploading of toolbar to the main server , where any other one can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present fails the loading .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , in the Tags menu , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; at present , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ref@@ using using toolbar buttons , if this tag is contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above listed menu items . click on it . click on an activated plug to de@@ activate it . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available selection schem@@ ata depends on the current file .
&quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS , or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes needs time or causing unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
set the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which can change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file is filled in automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ amp@@ le.com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to cou@@ p@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the check@@ box , scra@@ ping out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards possible ) which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger to be selected . currently , only Gu@@ bed will be supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles you can set high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by clicking its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited , or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as viewing a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at the moment . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the Di@@ alogue Project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave similarly , however the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button call@@ able context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is de@@ activated to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program . this option is useful when the frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for uploading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just one set of files and toolbar . in a project there can be many views , i.e. , by simply de@@ af the view , various files and toolbar buttons can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted at the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with whom you most have to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to your own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , can best be st@@ acked over the Tool@@ bar menu . usage and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is described below in the section &quot; &quot; adding tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and the icons can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar buttons or toolbar buttons can be set , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on these or other toolbar can be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries in action and action are displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up Tool@@ bar in the menu ... and set settings .
&quot; templates are basically a document skel@@ eton , code escal@@ opes and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; basically use templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template prior to use . &quot;
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents by links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in template tree under global templates . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in template tree under global templates . see for more information about the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document should always be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As a Template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select Text in your document and click File As a template , save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dro@@ pping onto the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used to copy all file management functions , such as drag and drop or insert the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view and create a site template , enter a name for the template and backup . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very pur@@ pos@@ eful way of thinking . you can specify head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically linking with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the templates is based on the files included in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a sel@@ ector with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template list . if a root folder would be set in such a way , it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless otherwise it would appear in a root folder . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allow previous or displayed text for templates in this folder . this might be common head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates in a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , provides two modes : V@@ PL ; &amp; V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and turn back on demand for source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green icon displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ om of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; to edit , is still the source code editor necessary . there are no plans to modify this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode functions exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the cursor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , this mode is already active , the push of the button moves the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; View , you can select between synchronization after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small gap for fast machines and a large gap for slow . &quot;
the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called upon as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this can be changed :
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows to change the content such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves odd . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and by pressing the button or removing key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as in the source editor , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed every other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some toolbar buttons , such as the She@@ ets Assistant or Listen @-@ Wiz@@ ard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; you will need to use the tables or lists toolbar buttons in this release . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile successfully , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;

&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top file name file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g working folder is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete match is checked with a suggestion called QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP template containing the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired holding point must be dis@@ b@@ anded for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools for comparison . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; while automatically selecting the correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with comparing and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and den@@ otes the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed clearly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble when nobody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other one differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by using only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
&quot; open dialog allows for manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; select Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders is initiated . if you select a file , however , for B and C a folder will be selected , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging is done , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diffusion ; only the case drop of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dro@@ pping text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , a small relief window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is recognized , you can see the color of which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) . &quot;
&quot; if differences have been found , the column shows the corresponding color . if differences in white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted in the digits where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is scored with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the title output : , the file name and &#91; changed &#93; when you edit the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving has been de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the window , the group belongs to the row in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navi@@ gates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page on , side down , end , Ctrl @-@ start and Ctrl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the window window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries will synchron@@ ize the view of all the windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Con@@ version and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( Ctrl @-@ Down / Ctrl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctrl @-@ F@@ ig down@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl @-@ Insert ) . if this is checked , whatever you select will automatically copy to the clip@@ board , but be careful with this option , as you may acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are using a new@@ line \ \ r \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line @-@ line of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences in a cur@@ sive font are displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered bl@@ ur@@ red . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ regulated colour . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the respective number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the return of the preceding line is automatically applied to the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual copy to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diffusion tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car backward character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . normally , files with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison might look identical , though they are treated differently . &quot;
&quot; this option is disabled in the first part of the analysis . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow in very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts resulting from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . check for details under documentation on directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
changing this option does not affect the current program . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must stop and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; in the selection fields for coding , a short notice appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processor commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ run column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C will be shown next to the normal still a second over@@ lap column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click will merge and use the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this function e.g. for cutting out bot@@ her@@ ing parts or for correct recovery . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff @-@ results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the entry into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitu@@ tion ) . all sequences follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now a pre @-@ processing command is needed to remove the text : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for poin@@ ter spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; used \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line distance al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Zei@@ l @-@ Pre@@ processor displays the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hi@@ des differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... &quot; makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start , &quot;
... can simul@@ ate contrac@@ tion and display the simulated changes without actually performing them
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merge individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small news window on current progress . if you cancel the file scanning , only the files that have been compared to that date are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right .
&quot; when you double click on a file , the file comparison will start and a comparison window will appear . &quot;
the symbol in column Name mirrors the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea behind this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if there is an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) is checked , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and performs the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the same date appears . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging , a file is executed after the other . the status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge was successful , and in accordance with other messages when something unexpected came up . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ ging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge operation . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t specify a destination folder , it is used as the destination in the Three Fol@@ der merge mode C , while the two @-@ folder merge mode is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries in the destination folder should be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types , a message appears indicating the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box with the options will appear , simul@@ ate and Cancel . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are done with a file , select another directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; your work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you avoid the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can try to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been combined individually , please refer to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not be displayed again . even if the merge action is ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; use a valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders don &apos;t have to correspond to this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set folder specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in the default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . for example , it may be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action instead of being merged . ( this is considered in@@ secure as it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is checked in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ OR@@ g extension exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between directory and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status is reset to Er@@ le@@ dges and the file will not be merged once you run the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : list menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax for local files and folders .
&quot; a path might be relative und@@ el@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; ( # - &gt; % 23 , characters - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . a short list of restrictions follows : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differentiated if a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit permissions or change of change . therefore , the permissions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently seen as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts always the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assume that the input file has a unified format . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original file from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Preview in the context menu Preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diffusion ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now make it Comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ uses from the diff tool collection . &quot;
&quot; I use GPL programs very long and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path , or they will go . &quot;
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed configure in / usr / local but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diffusion 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
&quot; if only the number of white characters varies , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is more often the case . &quot;
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could save this information .
&quot; so far , the effort has been too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has been created , and the text cannot be cleared . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diffusion ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diffusion 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists . &quot;
cut out ( Ctrl @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Ctrl @-@ V or Shift Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders don &apos;t appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function after changes to these options . )
&quot; there are only entries shown that show differences . this also causes identical files when mer@@ ging into the destination folder . if the destination folder already contains these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source using the A , B and C let@@ tering below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , clicking the button will be removed . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; moving is possible both inside a desktop and on other desktop . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when clicking on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; clicking , the context menu only has to set up the two entries p@@ ager ... and exit . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the commands will also appear as follows : &quot;
maximizes the application window to full size of desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are lab@@ eled with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1. desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty areas are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally it &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for representation at the side of the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select Swit@@ ches to set up ... Set@@ ting the Settings dialog .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; if you like &amp; K@@ mag ; launch , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the picture shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can get &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter displayed in the enlarged window , select the cursor position . please note that this &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you are using the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window stays firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , to copy it to the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to 0 .
&quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be shown . the selected area will be shown in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your inserted short commands to store files , opening a new window , print , new@@ ad ( with the button Pu@@ t document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and cl@@ ut@@ ters &amp; etc ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag is also known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; it is a magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; to do this , use a magni@@ fying screen to view the screen printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the cursor searches for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and any mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the cursor searches for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the re@@ peti@@ tive stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and mouse click pain . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , due to the mere moving of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click when you stop the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . now move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the mouse with pressed mouse button . this smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this residence time must be passed after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , exec@@ uting a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent delay is enabled , the pitch shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) becomes active . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait , before it release the mouse button again , if no move of the mouse takes place . &quot;
&quot; this function is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the tab General . there &apos;s a sli@@ ders sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; launched at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to launch a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of the application . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first , use the pres@@ ets . in particular , you should leave the smart move off . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; cor@@ k ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should make aware of which places a mouse click stays without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer stop by letting the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . by doing so , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset ; you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue exec@@ uting mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . however , you can park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to perform a keyboard hub . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front rows of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move , if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is done every time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button clicks a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when at the smart move the shift time begins . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the audi@@ ble mouse clicks feature is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button shortly after the mouse poin@@ ter stops . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome , and those of the mouse buttons are afflic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a drag action to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be done using the mouse . &quot;
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( enter either this &amp; URL , in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computers speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the conversation course , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command to be used later for the speech output of text . for more details see the description of the setup guide . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often select text passages used without having to type in . of course , text passages can be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be taken into words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the default memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , page wording and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , insert the encoding , with which text is passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as default . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endix . &quot;
&quot; with possibility t@@ d to use as language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text pass@@ age@@ book menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ y , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will first only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box closing the editing window for text passages , you can define whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Before Save , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth displays ; a drop @-@ down box when this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply calculated by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org language to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . there &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two sections . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting from the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry crosses , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar can be moved by default over the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the clever left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry crosses , a movable beam is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the toolbar can be moved over the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the clever left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for speech output correctly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card language output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a voice @-@ voice @-@ system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Malay@@ al@@ an are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ quet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to ph@@ one@@ tics for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just have to use Pos@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust . &quot;
&quot; to setup use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the &quot; &quot; setup dialog &quot; &quot; of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD installed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully using it , you need a language generator ( and course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends in detail on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak text through the computer . there is a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always re@@ charge . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a modules of existing service that allows any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . also , users can offer interesting possibilities . &quot;
&quot; read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; the speech output is done via the program speech dispens@@ er , the different background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ auxiliary program .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database by &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about and kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list via https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you must install program speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher and adjust properly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card card will be shown . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card map will be displayed General . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer can be compared to several printing queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card @-@ leading speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card will appear . this will also appear automatically if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet setup a speaker . &quot;
all speakers already set up will appear in this list . the top speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for speech output when an application does not pres@@ ume a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
&quot; choose a type of voice , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map General and check if the voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed , and you can create text orders and read them . see . remove the mark , is stopped and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , running &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the preview is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , cancel , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an assignment . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all settings changed on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card print runs only when K@@ TT@@ SD has been launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map tab General and check the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that is to be read , and select tool text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ ten@@ ders and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check the text that is to be read , and select tool text in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; k@@ ates ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Qu@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages also by and kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up a message when your nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu preferences of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Qu@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before being sent to the program speech dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these jobs . if the output of the screen reader is read , the queu@@ ed orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enter the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; -@@ al@@ erts are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order you receive from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a preview , this output will be stopped and stopped . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; fonts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be provided with pre@@ defined string substitute filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re @-@ format@@ ting of messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; XHTML , contained in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set up a female voice on the board map , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . si@@ eh@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter det@@ ects that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be edited by all filters that were set up on the page below . editing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the details below will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting fonts filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column substitu@@ tion . the list is executed in the indicated order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker speaks for one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages by pressing the &quot; &quot; Ctrl &quot; &quot; key when you click . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of ongoing programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers need to be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you are allowed to enter only copy . &quot;
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared with words , the string implementation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. words must therefore be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&quot; XML ; trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such modifications . however , it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable PAT@@ H it is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the Spe@@ aker function filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card card speaker or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that indicate the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the properties of the speakers created on the map board . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you define the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text is filled with the filter conditions above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when apply . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the speech output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand language output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . launch kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phones , so that SA@@ B@@ LE does not work at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or printed only ch@@ ew@@ ing wel@@ sh . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the code encoding option is set to the correct language for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string implementation filter . &quot;

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that own a license .
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; download it . you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also , look at the page of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including package k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech dispens@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ dep@@ ots , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program using the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech dis@@ pat@@ cher works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech dispens@@ er is directly possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into single sentences . the user can go back , repeat the sentence or reject it , stop or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application has text in &amp; kt@@ ts ; over there , it can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its sex is female , it will be used automatically the best fitting speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on add speaker on the card map , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card will display speaker setup . as an example , the module will display the module for Festival Interactive . for details on the modules you will find under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the festival &apos;s exec@@ utable . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you will have to enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text that is passed to Festival . if voices , the kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers and display this gray , the voice you choose does not allow you to select these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to pause and control the read . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the currently processed sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card card spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can proceed from or back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text orders are listed and administr@@ ated . issues of screen re@@ a@@ vers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information about the types of messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200 . % about the double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program needs to be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click App@@ ly to apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech applications : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the queu@@ ed orders are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a regular text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and spending of screen re@@ a@@ vers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to let with &amp; kt@@ ts ; Read C@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card menu will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch to &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks , al@@ erts when a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conf@@ is@@ cation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list will be ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to define what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; when you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed in the list on the card card speaker as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the Event All al@@ erts for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the messages to be sent as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the Save button to save the noti@@ fications for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks used for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . besides , SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice used to the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ 0.1 % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; * ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits det@@ ecting filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sentences . this can be done faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized or stop or stop assignments , even if the speech syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you see the set limits identification filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a default a set limit detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set limits filter , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and input text to read . check the speaker selection once again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ ts ; then faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time &quot;
&quot; you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card map , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set recognition filter will be automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only be removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
phrase recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ hy@@ mes are removed before the filter automatically from the text ) . note that the default acc@@ ination filter will retain the set @-@ up .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the standard cross border identi@@ fier , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map of the card , you can over@@ write the speech settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card board spokes@@ person ) . in other words : no speaker features are defined .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that closest to the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to enter desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the desired speaker &apos;s properties here . if this feature does not matter , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several marks here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor when publishing the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is preferred if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker field , which is closest to the following , click the Def@@ ault spokes@@ person button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get trac@@ eability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer yet . if the problem is not resolved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the console ; appears a message stating : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . find clu@@ es for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; I have uploaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s like festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pres@@ et . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage that websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival spokes@@ person , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the festival does not produce errors , raises the x@@ s@@ l file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own label asser@@ tion filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or going back . on the tab jobs will be shown , the order will consist only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , excl@@ am@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . instead , use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional border detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command register . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and let you read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also free@@ ze when you start a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot;
&quot; with as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you keep a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the speech speed , but is not necessarily required . Debian users can then install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded as tar@@ ball ( packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the configure option to switch off shows the configure parameter which causes the transition of the creation .
&quot; default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot;
on Debian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from the sources .
CD k@@ dep@@ access@@ echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you got with the syn@@ thesizer .
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you have to install at least one language . help to do this in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ r@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ r@@ il@@ lic like e.g. ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ onic . Festival generates these by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found at .
&quot; in this procedure additional wra@@ pper code will be added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for german &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the inclusion of the error corrections is not necessary , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; voice @-@ location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot;
&quot; on some systems , you need to edit the / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m file . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to give the language of the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; give and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download festival Czech from
un@@ pack the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .
load the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip it into the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , open voice syn@@ thesizer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for Fl@@ ite as the first one on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o program transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice syn@@ thesizer generates the sound . the voice quality is good , but the support is currently limited in a few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
download at least a German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; either copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c , or after / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; on the map Device Setup , select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly . &quot;
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , open voice syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume in this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g . on the map spokes@@ person , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS language syn@@ thesizer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card card spokes@@ person . in the input fields , you can enter additional parameters for the programs . in the input fields , type in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; e@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , open voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java , neither pitch , volume nor talk speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use a command to write the speech output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by matching the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
the network settings module will be loaded when the network settings option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index . when starting the module network settings this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and release date . by marking the setting no @-@ again queries , the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can click the button System Administrator Mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
&quot; setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button &quot; &quot; Kn@@ itting &quot; &quot; ... in the Device Configuration dialog . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are picked up from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are made for the system at the same time . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or disabled depending on your needs . power @-@ on of a switched @-@ off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . dis@@ ab@@ ling an enabled network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS automatically dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the Rei@@ tz name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , remove or altered . DNS records may be sorted by selecting a entry and ascending or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the button &apos;s or herr@@ ing in the priority list . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... Edi@@ ting the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally the list contains a list of names named , which are called &quot; &quot; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , then press the Add button several times and enter the alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit the machine will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the Network Settings module are not immediately activated in the system . to activate the changes , you have to set the following command . &quot;
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as a package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , on the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section can not replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been widely spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to pers@@ ist in the near future . this description is currently focuss@@ ed on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be associated . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the point of contact that matches a valid IP address or , if available , can not simply be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway . &quot;
for smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
&quot; additionally , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the port address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
in this part are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content as defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file will be re@@ ass@@ or@@ ted by the scripts in Su@@ SE config . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and closed . &quot;
&quot; if the task is de@@ activated , the program name and parameter will not be shown and the description will be de@@ activated . &quot;
the environment variables appearing here use the otherwise existing environment variables for all the tasks listed above . in a de@@ activated variable appears as a description de@@ activated .
&quot; in order to create a new task , first select the task folder . then go to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also right click on the tasks folder and press New ... Select or Ctrl ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to be launched here . you can either specify a relative or absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , click Select .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; if you select both mon@@ th@@ day ( s ) and day of the week ( s ) , the task will be performed both at a suitable date and on a suitable day of the week . if you select the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be run regardless of the day of the week on the 1st and 15th of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as in the creation of new tasks , changes will be active only when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to be removed . then proceed to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select drop@@ outs , or press Ctrl ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select Copy , or press Ctrl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first you have to cut into the clip@@ board or have been copied . only then is inser@@ ting at all available . select the tasks folder . then go to Edit Insert . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and select Insert , or press Ctrl ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , first select one . then go to Edit Chang@@ ing the menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and change ... Select , or press Ctrl ; O. It will then appear the dialogue task in which you can edit the task described above . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task you want to delete . then go to the Edit menu item . &quot;
&quot; to activate or disable a task , select it , and determine the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in their description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select En@@ abled . make sure that the program name , parameter and description will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to run a task right away , select it and then proceed to Edit now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to Edit New .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and New ... Select , or press Ctrl ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variables . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the laun@@ ch@@ able program to another one than the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then proceed to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select Copy , or press Ctrl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to add an environment variable , first you have to cut into the clip@@ board or have been copied . only then is the Insert option available at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit Insert . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to edit . then go to Edit .... Altern@@ atively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and change ... Select , or press Ctrl ; O .@@ It will then appear the dialog box in which you can edit the variable as described above . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to activate or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it , and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . in a de@@ activated variable , under description De@@ activation . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select En@@ able . make sure the name and value of the variables will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press Ctrl ; s . changes or additions to tasks or variables will become active only . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default cass@@ ette ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose fl@@ aps , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced permissions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the time schedules of users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it provides the ability to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a tar surface , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ stores the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the band . det@@ ects and k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ cursor searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the strap , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sli@@ ders into the same page !
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , it needs to happen before you are format@@ ted by the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; however , flo@@ ppy tape drives do not require format@@ ting of the tape , while DAT drives do not . &quot;
after entering the band name and capacity &amp; k@@ dat ; continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically mounted and is ready for use .
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save As ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the Settings for Backup opens . in this dialog you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu item Test ....
&quot; once the scan is started , the dialog box appears for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the verification , the dialog will appear to be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu ....
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the Settings for Recovery will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
the dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band index@@ .@@ This process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways from the band :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings will be created . you can set the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in it are backed up on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape appliance .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitting &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when releasing the em@@ bedding of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy @-@ stream . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you must inform you &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is the machine name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file directory .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be administered directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this icon is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system stores the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users for quick access , for example , to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence tries to provide some advanced functions , with which help the log files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 uses &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with whose help the single protocol lines of a log file can easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are displayed in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . if you do not display it , and it opens instead of its a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are normally not found in the directory / var / log , for normal users usually no authorization to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered string . to do this , enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines is now displayed automatically , so that only log lines are shown next to the filter . then a log line is only displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then be matched only with entries in the selected column . in addition , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines .
&quot; if you want to display only specific process ( e.g. in system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming log lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log for displaying in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. There you find more current information on the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; . this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the System V In@@ it quickly became standard for the control of program start @-@ up when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . and , for that reason , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and reform@@ at@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things like Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; if you need it , r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches for the program in@@ it at various points and starts the first one that he finds .
the default run level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default setting level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does it start and does in@@ it actually stop system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that there is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server runtime that runs only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user runtime , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level ( or stop it ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by dra@@ gging it somewhere else .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to just copy them to a new one , you have to explicitly choose Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no possibility to restore entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the different working areas ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another runtime , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctrl ; X ) and insert it into the desired runtime with insert ( with Ctrl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; otherwise changes to the preferences are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
type on the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press Enter to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit / etc / init@@ tab and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions stream@@ lines the configuration for the proprietary programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) can be terminated simply without notice if their configuration files are not present or wron@@ g@@ ly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; runtime varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ;
&quot; after you have made any changes , you have to save it . either use the respective icon on the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user / group properties . &quot;
&quot; some map cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have activated space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the card card password management appears if shadow passwords , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
this card file only appears if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with space restriction by means of the field file system .
&quot; the group map groups are informed about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user is heard , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Properties Tab of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove the boot password , remove and change the time until bo@@ oting the standard operating system , add , remove , remove , change and remove operating systems . &quot;
