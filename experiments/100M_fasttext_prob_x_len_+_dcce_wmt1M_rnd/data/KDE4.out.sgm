<seg id="12">"to use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as a default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists in representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"& FSView; size is the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder as the sum of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. hence, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the treemap file represents a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the picture of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can define whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area is to be used by subordinate rectangles (whereby, therefore, the relative position of the labels can be set in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of performance algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the treemap in & FSView; this target will not always be complied with. it will be drawn to indicate that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is up to the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames always favourably to divide the areas that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can designate the minimum displayed area for an entry through the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent dialog to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry."</seg>

<seg id="61">"& digitised; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digitised; if you are a regular user of & digitised; then we would like to answer questions to other users of & digities.In this mailing list, however, you should speak English, you should therefore be powerful in this language."</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitisation; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digitisation;</seg>
<seg id="63">"the best way to get involved & digitised; to participate, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in in the developer mailing list of & digitised;."</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you start & digitisation; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. just enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all the image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digitised; will also be used as an alpha library. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>

<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Allowlist do not have photos as symbols. you can change it by using any photo from the album and use it on the folder icon. see the Albums tab for more details."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can edit & edit your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the help menu resource support."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decoder Options and Roh workflow.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission.</seg>
<seg id="75">"the gPhoto2 program also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is meanwhile outdated. & digious; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. the Exif support is required by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may possibly see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about & digitised; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digitised;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & digitised; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or move in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images functions anywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree tree, over the horizontal dividing line or into another application window."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common ones: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter will only be used for the fields indicated in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name only works if this ind it is also shown. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the preferences."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the View & quot; My Albenlistequot; puts an organized view on your photo albums. all the photos stored by & digitised are sorted in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, according to the name of their collection in the properties of the album or after the date on which the album was first created."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import Images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Import screenshot."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse over the target album and drop it there."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album- collections: are a method to mark your albums, so that you can be grouped by a common name. the collection is used to sort your photos when you choose to add or delete new collections by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album Date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the Elders Elders, Average, New Testers: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or that of the album's average. to this end, the average of the images from their EXIF information will be used. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"if you first have an album in & edited, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is meant to help you remember the photos on the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>

<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">The collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of these preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a bit while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this, in which you can recreate all thumbnails in the Tools menu."</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information on or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">"if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use without inventory management to find a particular photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digitised;. the approach to store metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">"holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website."</seg>
<seg id="152">"professional photographers have different requirements, e.g. versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content."</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>

<seg id="378">"when the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he must press for the results he would like. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition to you, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow complies with all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Compare, Automatically Delete and Contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction try automatically from your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity across the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the brightness depth factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. thus, nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels. sometimes, the same very good results are achieved in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balancing: this method maximises the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light fronts and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete history of the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancement: this method improves contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a restart of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digitised; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a colour space with 8-bit pro colour. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure occur. if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode, which operates in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be improved."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image as well as the preview of the target image are to be seen. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"a histogram shows that dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed. you will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button restores all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings may also be displayed as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles. it uses the modification and assigning color profiles. color-mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously to allow you to use it for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the tone correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digious; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure exerted a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity control the solar ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is possible chemically. a further upliftment eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">"this is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1), and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%."</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colors brilliant and glow. try it, it embellished lots of photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot, and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts."</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the repetitions repetitions the strength of the neon light. with large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photo. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitised; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but generates particularly in dark areas, grained pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture more sharper. in fact, it doesn't matter a bit, it works rather psychotropic. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a point of view. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour pixels are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG images, a camera often has been used internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a sharpening filter already while reading the image. if you disable them, you get control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this can be called with the menu item Correcting sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can achieve more information and comparison of all techniques to sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften with the menu item Correct softly and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter fuzzy masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried out first. an increase in radius or the amount intensifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of graten in the vicinity of sharp edges will generate."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore images should be best sharpened in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference. one can thereby define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft transition between the tones are avoided with sharpening, thus avoiding beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example for the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image is the (2). blurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfission-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0,1 are only rarely helpful."</seg>
<seg id="502">"if you use a value nonzero, you may also need to increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try out all trimming, color and intensity gradients on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later left unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurry masks produce better results than sharpening. this could cause blurry masking to use a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, blurry masking always must create artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it is never possible to remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharpened color picture needs to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the smoothie regulates the sharpness of the area of the darkened, so as to create a more natural pupil."</seg>
<seg id="514">"ink tints allow an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unrivalled artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed retention p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should be kept in a uniform way. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpening is necessary retroactively."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film gritt or CCD rugs will generate a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it needs to be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angular stepwidth da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the higher quality you get by choosing this option is only low, but it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to skip it."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. to correct any setting of image errors, it can be saved in a text file and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters available to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer obtain and noise or lubricate occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: control edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma olerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically smoky and also lubricated the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges will appear smooth when it is too high, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">Saving and loading: these buttons are used exactly for this. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how room reduction can change your life. the original image is labelled with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu item Correct softly and experiment with the smoothie. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove the palate, film bastion, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures."</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a low-loss compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefakequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block."</seg>

<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flap at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrects the removed corners to that of the second grader. if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the strength of distortion Second Grades. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values are corpted distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the inverted sign of the parameter generally."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>

<seg id="615">Zoom: wipes the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the sharpness of a zoomizing camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: wipes the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance unsharpendicular: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion blur: wipes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">This creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits and glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: wipes the image through random displacement of pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the colour basins in the image and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>

<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you blow an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformers size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflate was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>

<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden mean is divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks, which used to design your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden mean provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will provide you with good results for your photos. in comparison to the third-level rule the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can make a static object dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect of the dynamic symmetry called dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently."</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button, you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>

<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the Image Processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to enhance or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module, you can import or convert your RAW files stored in RAW formats to one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"as soon as you are pleased with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information in your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later use it, you should not select the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch conversion mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the option to automatically overwrite existing file. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>

<seg id="922">"in this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically discussed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set. so, it can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get an image bigger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>

<seg id="1041">"in the combination field quality, you can select the properties, which & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection illumination. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;"</seg>
<seg id="1042">"if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling the adjacent pixels with inputs. the second method is adaptive-recursively, because each pixel is distributed over and over again and adaptively because the recursive depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray is pursuing a beam per pixel. if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixels is scanned with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be computed, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually pursued and checked for further division. the maximum depth of the recursion allows you to adjust with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch to Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information obtained manually or fetched by the program automatically from the FreeDB over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>

<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (note of the translation: this is meant by the author). however, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be hurt."</seg>

<seg id="1538">"the encoding package must be installed from the Linux distribution, before the encoding can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoding. for more information about coDivers, refer to the chapter Welcher Kodierer."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (rifle shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term" "drum patch" "the patch is meant to be a different percussionic instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to depict sounds on the percussions-channel. watch as an example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap must be used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions-channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio is indicated in which ratio of pitch Bender events will be multiplied. if so, a MIDI file sends a pitch-bender event with the value n, this will be converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commits in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM pretends to play a keyboard that gets a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two notes up to an octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button no longer illuminates green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played notes. view the View menu under the View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo lcd indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can run on two different devices with very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anyone to use kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"that can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that's because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's frontpage)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, therefore supports & mid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; -window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"previously, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI-folder and & kmid; -window with my MIDI-folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a karaoke file) or when I want to play a file, just go to the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file to the window of & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, switch the Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files"</seg>
<seg id="1692">"suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">"these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue programming."</seg>

<seg id="2064">Note that the Table of Contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & lt; character. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is indicated. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file and save it to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (like you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>

<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, are you not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places, there is an Email send menu entry, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with Email, send tool toolbar with Email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resource can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus. the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team considers them to be correct and useless for publication. to make a contribution, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource you need to fill out the input field (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD Package (DTEP) menus, upload tool slides, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>

<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in any day XML format might be necessary. there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package."</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone, who is & quantaplus; uses, available. from toolbar over actions, everything that is as global is saved in the shared folder structure by & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to backup different tools, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool slides. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which embeds the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparison. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly happened within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are displayed clearly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble when nobody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>

<seg id="2343">"if you define preprocessor commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands."</seg>

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff-results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for pointer spacing. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit and every hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" speech Dispatcher "works with a text."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of screen readern has the highest priority. it is withdrawn to all other orders and keeps these jobs. if the output of the screen reader is read, the queued orders will be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">"messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; anyone who just enter the room. & kmouth; -alerts are also messages."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. any order you receive from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output longer texts, which have no particular urgency."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four types of orders are processed in queues, except for screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such a preview, this output will be stopped and stopped."</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"fonts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be provided with predefined string substitute filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the re-formatting of messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included in & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML, contained in SSML."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"with speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set up a female voice on the board map, you can read text from KDE messages about it. siehe. read about it."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, the text remains unchanged to the next filter."</seg>

<seg id="2836">"for this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not only, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"this is recommended to experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"in the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, on the second all of & knetworkconf; alterable configuration files are discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace any further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never been widely spread. IPv6 is expected to persist in the near future. this description is currently focussed on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">"one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be associated. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the point of contact that matches a valid IP address or, if available, can not simply be chosen arbitrarily!"</seg>
<seg id="2842">"when placing an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their use is possible."</seg>
<seg id="2843">"of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway."</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">"additionally, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet."</seg>
<seg id="2846">"some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding."</seg>
<seg id="2847">"the port address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit."</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>

<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered string. to do this, enter a string in the filter bar. the list of the log lines is now displayed automatically, so that only log lines are shown next to the filter. then a log line is only displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then be matched only with entries in the selected column. in addition, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so show you & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only specific process (e.g. in system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter strip."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming log lines."</seg>

<seg id="2957">"the System V Init quickly became standard for the control of program start-up when running the system in the & Linux world. and, for that reason, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following more folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things like Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"if you need it, rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program init at various points and starts the first one that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default run level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default setting level 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and does init actually stop system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that there is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runtime that runs only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user runtime, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to just copy them to a new one, you have to explicitly choose Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no possibility to restore entries thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the different working areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runtime, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runtime with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
