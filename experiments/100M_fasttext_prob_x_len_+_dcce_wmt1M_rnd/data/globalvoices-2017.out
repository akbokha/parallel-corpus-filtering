&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , watched American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who was tas@@ ked with the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , its diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very warm letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly den@@ ies his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in flocks for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party nom@@ in@@ ee . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tru@@ mp and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s didn &apos;t agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix sun at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also contrary to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp was making his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; setting up people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act and think differently .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , have voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . D . ) : as much as &quot; Resol@@ utions of the White against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; Wor@@ ship of white in reference to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has done so mag@@ nific@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas offering this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd poured out . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out and their voices became lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a coherent and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan agreed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , it is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Turkey &apos;s land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , very popular among tourists , but worlds away from nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ key you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , map@@ le , tim@@ pani , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the kids of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recovered instruments made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura reminds itself of the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place at which the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . the kids didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them didn &apos;t live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin produced from tr@@ ash .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra that plays instruments of recovered material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in the liber@@ ian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the eastern afri@@ can countries were raised accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seychelles were mobili@@ sed swi@@ f@@ tly against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries which you simply refused to do , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries which at that time had driven the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up for each other , where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and even through the sn@@ ail emp@@ o to communicate with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea with satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , suspic@@ ious travel routes can be discovered - such as suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish fan@@ fare , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm committed to fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , losing the eight members of H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world . among these illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include activities like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of f@@ antasi@@ es , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ coherent control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t start my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front functions . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 vessels of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had spread fal@@ si@@ fied licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persec@@ uted and found refuge ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that love to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different levels of information . it aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
&quot; however , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can indeed influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot;
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Environment Agency Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data , and can be viewed worldwide via the position of every track@@ able ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ra@@ ct criminals , but also terri@@ fy them . &quot;
&quot; ships , who had previously been f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know they are being watched . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i are now experiencing a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fis@@ her boats buy more licenses since then . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped Somalia det@@ ecting Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together to join the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also combat the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state could report its first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they were going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after rej@@ ecting the opposition &apos;s motion to a referendum on the dism@@ iss@@ al , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emp@@ tin@@ ess by assembling on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the order of Venezuela ) you can find both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north federal parliament of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which makes itself felt in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the attitude of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government resolution as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and appar@@ at@@ uses are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % for the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the only way to give the country the opportunity to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups united , called upon the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter amongst others as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the fairy tales , published in real time , include an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
&quot; hours later they could leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National gar@@ di@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already makes the lap that trains the amount of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an office concept - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your resume of office !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , did little against the dis@@ astro@@ us economic crisis and preferred to allow critical voices to be stopped . &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or to go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself . &quot;
in the situation back then I believed it was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret magnet .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the 141 secret service department in La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who is accused of kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who before a Federal Court pronounced against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started taking me to the military base , I went to the sports hall often with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t forget that you don &apos;t have to kid@@ n@@ ap you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party . &quot;
that &apos;s why he offered me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had educated me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small box wrapped in a blan@@ ket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great lum@@ ps of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I approached and saw a couch , where people were tor@@ tured . &quot;
she looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
&quot; they rarely bound a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ cast him with water and hun@@ ted him into the gen@@ itals for 220 vol@@ ts . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a fil@@ thy Win@@ der .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same od@@ or came from his room . &quot;
I immediately realized the smell again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ?
I knew those people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses where naked people were lying with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people were silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you see , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me back ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew those people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my dad told me about it .
&quot; besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to information from survivors by the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , you can see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from the top came that they were to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ mu@@ te &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ time &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military insignia which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; And you who st@@ ole cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded fur@@ y , hit me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I wore a jacket and a roll pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still took home clothes . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a con@@ spir@@ ator accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have thus executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ n@@ apped children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could easily have put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families with whom to surrender their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last disgu@@ sting act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crus@@ hed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness in his account .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly abandoned and asked me , what all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to take part in this .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Well , let me show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I delivered the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; no one can repro@@ ach me , that I am pre@@ occupied . finally , I have spoken against my own father . &quot;
&quot; in May 2015 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : among them heavy , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of one under ten years of age . &quot;

the verdi@@ cts in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the particle size of the judgment . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were verdi@@ cts . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ State terrorism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military families , former police and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , which represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country where La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;

adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , last month &apos;s witness to a very un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; stolen &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; , &quot; wron@@ g@@ ly - maybe also with vi@@ cious h@@ ind thanks and # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful car &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to 20th of September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n daily published in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correct .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally incorrect designation &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture were ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text , which they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger wrote as follows about the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News became more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ some &quot; older drivers far@@ ther in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , who are involved in accidents across the country , is quite a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of altogether 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by the sen@@ iors increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ porter , named not named , brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation error has among other things got the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful car &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; so faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for over@@ laying , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge in order to understand the original text and active language skills in order to transfer him to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translator in the target language - should not be in the original language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign employees , can still make translations into their own . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real . &quot;

machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the pro@@ ver@@ ted and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences , which are created by machine translation , show that this technique can not substitute for a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood at all . &quot;
photo by Flickr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors like jewelry still acceptable , or at least harmless . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Kyoto uses a rep@@ utable source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ uses on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they wouldn &apos;t have access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also survived recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups opposed to Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was scar@@ ce , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ it : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are re @-@ locked again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of turbul@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report on protests . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fel@@ dt later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers use DNA at times . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS blocking : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government controls Internet connections : with this , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country continues to be more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves in order to obtain education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ cket as a child . now she is visiting the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers witness statements from other Cri@@ Baden who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with her family .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . when Cri@@ adi@@ tas refers to Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her min@@ der@@ old son or her min@@ der@@ old daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to afford a countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - Coll@@ ected witness statements , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they can conclude their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; is handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with himself and justi@@ fies his exploitation by faith , is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even star@@ ve . &quot;
victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; the guesthouse is U@@ th@@ o with nine apartments in a privileged position see @-@ side , in front of the dike , directly on the endless Ording beach . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra filed a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply responsible for the death of the girl in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions both boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbor of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations requested an immediate investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be tr@@ end@@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes from court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated by other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to go all work and started selling swe@@ ets on the street , or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that she still remained for learning . &quot;
it stood every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; Fri@@ days , for example , cle@@ ans@@ ed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they were done with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the house &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings the house@@ wife Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , standing next to him and reading editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator regime .
&quot; he thought it intelligent , but didn &apos;t stop with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there . so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would again speak their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible to lose .
&quot; however , her was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans to whom Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me at home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for clean@@ ers and ma@@ ids in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ anov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year history . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the inland who wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the authors switched to the ad once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ H@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , as long as ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani and their &quot; wives &quot; ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to ens@@ la@@ ved tribute to their wives ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were slaves ) and the system of slavery in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill introduced Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; sixty @-@ five Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ s@@ men recently voted in a draft law on &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators regarding use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt need to register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running and used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video directing and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , since the draft cannot indicate how Egyptian authorities are able to impose the registration on their users . unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ adh Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and editor of the bill of legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users of the Ministry of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no diver@@ ging scar is present on the surface , &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliam@@ ent@@ s@@ men Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest protest . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal shel@@ ters H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and health and thri@@ ving of the ecosystem also depends on a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to show a different side of her country that is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for northeast Japan , documented the progress made in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have spark@@ ed the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an et@@ ectable pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused whole coastal cities to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; even more , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had a nuclear accident , already alone that alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the lives of the local residents . &quot;
the report provides detailed comparative data on the number of deals and their value categ@@ orized into deal types and sub @-@ sector .
&quot; the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitu@@ tions were completed ( sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , one still tries , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by shel@@ ters ( &quot; &quot; kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) &quot; &quot; in final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation raised after the disaster in homes of homes were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have res@@ um@@ ed its operation . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear black@@ out zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains largely de@@ pressed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper produced numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung comments : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
as it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic event , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who still live in shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . it is well known because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if you encounter people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that more than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we are watching closely these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ese explains how a hike re@@ members their affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London , and Jo@@ ey A@@ you@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia last Friday . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures throughout the country .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which rapidly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident of the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he pic@@ ks up in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing at the intensive station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ i@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video footage recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and hur@@ ries several san@@ it@@ ees shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also reflected in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover some of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ er@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was engaged in the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined forces to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement after he was attacked by a police officer who attacked him with a stroke . &quot;
&quot; posts : 2,@@ 3@@ 63 &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where last Friday led to brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in the center of Rio de Janeiro where demonstr@@ ators set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media sli@@ pped street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported about a broken glass window in order to design their title pages in an illustr@@ ative way .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a brand placed on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause . &quot;
you also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of Un@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba included the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant crop harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after all , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still ad@@ mon@@ ish .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region there are sugar cane factories , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene seems to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already with@@ drew the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for dis@@ quiet@@ ening for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest is no longer a novel@@ ty . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old train station of the municipality looked even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories producing sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , published according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; this was the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the breakdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repe@@ ating is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to preserve the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first session , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which were only distinguished from the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ s@@ ate and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any dem@@ on . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was exceeded and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation , &quot; &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important division of work has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were created for jobs and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run smoothly . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to de@@ em it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ es other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they have become spare parts .
&quot; without a prospects for the future , many young people even left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

&quot; young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have brought mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop concludes that the young participants discuss topics like &quot; cultural identity , speech , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the School &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ um@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
most of the cases were not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always speak of the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who sent them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
&quot; this is the day when you will hear our cry , &quot;
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so they can grow , and as do our youth move forward &quot;
so they can do what they have appointed the Creator
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan

in Japan you can see plastic dishes before almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance to the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ go san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they won &apos;t notice them even more . however , a new trend nowadays turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ go san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic rib@@ bed mobile belts as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new Boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone support .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lol ) we have found a good use as a mobile phone support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
&quot; some mobile teleph@@ ones and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon dec@@ eived ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also friction balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand tapes of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes , you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , which means it &apos;s su@@ ire $ su@@ ire code . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ go san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ ses and fe@@ ed@@ backs appear regularly only in statistics . however , these do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely against the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone finds in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and stories of people who came into battle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project in this way :
organized crime not only allows us to be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father looking for every weekend secret tom@@ bs looking for his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we also prepare ourselves today for the task we have placed ourselves , and to look for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; where shall we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with the disease and sen@@ tim@@ ation journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin is thinking that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal for people to hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is as if they are ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the non@@ violence of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; &quot; pos@@ sessions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to be persu@@ aded that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed by threats for month . &quot; in this , it describes how armed criminals pres@@ sured the money from their business for month until they were not only destroying their business , but also torn their family apart . &quot;
you think of all you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain is never ending , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will be kid@@ n@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I wondered if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the ver@@ ge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father who was shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor named 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 deaths per day . &quot;
these are just a few of the hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ging a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to explain the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the sides to which he links contains images on which violence is represented .
the factor check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to be@@ g trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials also described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses twi@@ sted and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident inc@@ ur the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies lying on the floor while watching them .
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and acci@@ dentally wrote real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted in a figur@@ ative way . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example , wron@@ g@@ ly fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning detection , published by the United Nations , those who escaped could flee blows , rape and a number of dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , which was wron@@ g@@ ly stated in 2012 , the president My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Being had said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed by the end of April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had wron@@ g@@ ly attributed this statement to Th@@ ein , but had not linked the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these fake coupl@@ ings date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can go beyond borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image of DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix of private sites , social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded false reports , others have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have defined examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what they have been published on which side they have been published . by doing so , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which are also linked with each other ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ usive use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture of the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Buddhist practitioners against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this article from 2014 about students en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Catho@@ lic@@ ist news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later fell into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the daily El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there would be links to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ fertili@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is burning ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo turned out , provided with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to those events , which took place presum@@ ably in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mart@@ os dis@@ soci@@ ated from the Embassy , in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in Gra@@ u ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are sixty people who acci@@ dentally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of wrong and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dissemination of violent pictures has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that rej@@ ecting images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent pictures may des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some issues to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used from the context or completely mis@@ used species . &quot;
&quot; however , every study of false ten@@ ders should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transc@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g . insur@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to be translated at all . &quot;
&quot; these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ re@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists are dealing with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lators &quot; &quot; Steven B@@ ird to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you will find , for example , words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - take care of your parents in recognition of how much you have made for you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after getting war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they de@@ cip@@ her other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
speakers of Treasure Langu@@ ages that are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite spots here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and disaster disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya occurred in 15 districts in the south and west of the country via the banks . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people are missing due to floo@@ ds and slu@@ dges . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ inf@@ all left on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water bo@@ oths in some areas went slowly . &quot;
the health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the H@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ bre@@ optic crisis , warns the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water @-@ peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made for the transport of emergency deliveries for the inhabitants involved in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also resolved to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if you need help in this area . &quot;
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data using the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people with floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now ahead of the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust in her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we are still calling for the rights of women . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , we are advoc@@ ating rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ il@@ ding slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they de@@ pl@@ ore me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow , we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims as I do not fit in there will be ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot;
will be ev@@ acu@@ ated
I am not alone .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you think of when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these paintings in the 1970s .
but these pictures rise further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them . &quot;
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful and flaw@@ ed Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and to cover Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
&quot; it looks beyond that the first Muslim prayer was spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has filled our collective imagination such deeply and flaw@@ ed , that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming a target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account in the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

approved use .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then when Khan was re@@ thinking about the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ avo@@ idable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ avo@@ idable Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ bags with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also not be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be almost always chosen for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well for@@ ged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who under@@ takes the veil of a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it acc@@ esses our identity , which is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists express religious life , they grasp the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslim , if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses for the protection that sealed the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the picture of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; how she won a contest of the art of arran@@ ging a flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and an Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had said to me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ alised by an &quot; Imperi@@ um , &quot; which has established a company named Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ die Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my beloved grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and about In@@ dependence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ a , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt un@@ avo@@ idable around his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country in a century ago .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion belong deep into our unforgettable family trees , our unknown history . &quot;
&quot; it means to recall that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent except Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate in veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy comes to the United States and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that more than fourteen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple bin@@ ds , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced duality of &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in the Muslim regi@@ stra@@ des , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that are bombing it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is mainly targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we carry , and the bombs we throw at Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sli@@ ghtest score .
the conversations that we have to carry
&quot; we are deeply advised to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous pic@@ torial im@@ prints that we do in our news editorial . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ RSS ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to propag@@ ate Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me a un@@ avo@@ idable Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why should I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation were enth@@ r@@ alled four decades even scientific of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of him , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we had no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban voice diversity
&quot; story telling , by Flickr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
&quot; for Steven B@@ ird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling Initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices report recently about another initiative by Steven B@@ ird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of cities in large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project apply :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be part of . &quot;
&quot; while listening to this often is connected to &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; listening to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story t@@ ellers will first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation lead to the audience . &quot;
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional Burkina Faso story , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ad also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of nar@@ ration typical to her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ mus@@ ara tells the f@@ abel from the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ mus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you listened !
you were aware ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of public debt by the US
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ constitution of debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audi@@ ting and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be reconc@@ iled with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not incorporated into the state alliance of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and family continue to campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , hosted an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , produced prints from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is an hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction there is :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what are the real costs associated with this . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; &quot; military police Bass@@ el &quot; &quot; had taken part as a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it had been contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 who pres@@ i@@ ded themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its place of residence and state remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels was more pre@@ ten@@ tious than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the hub of numerous civili@@ zations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to make this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ mis@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015 , when he was imprisoned . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked on the book for one year .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is freely available .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards &quot;
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
&quot; and I enter into every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
&quot; that I wear with passion , &quot;
if your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I will let another piece of my soul be with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
to bring back all the moments
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope that we have to do for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : re @-@ release of corruption convic@@ ted after corruption
&quot; at the same time , Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger against corruption in which a government member returned to the State apparatus after half of his sentence of imprisonment on which corruption was perpet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants , due to in@@ vari@@ ance of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was provided by Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to resume its old post since the company did not undergo disciplinary procedure after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the opposing character .
&quot; however , the company seems to have no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be couns@@ ellor after he was sentenced to jail and half of whom has served . &quot;
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches ; he could advise and polish his image .
&quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he has unanim@@ ously approved to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
reluc@@ t@@ antly !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not possess any moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was pre @-@ invited and finally condemned to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remain in memory not only for ever as the first independent president , but also as a shar@@ per , Cutter , and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being crimin@@ ally at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting 10 years and escaped . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , with which he makes money , is under contract . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î²@@ Î¹@@ Ðº &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the racial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users un@@ ju@@ stly
&quot; the Bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ a or don@@ or . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Article , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to refer to East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely distor@@ ted con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today Kal@@ ar is normally associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech . &quot;
context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have vo@@ iced doubt for their use .
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ul@@ lab@@ ia A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles a rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will l@@ essen the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before all the Po@@ sts extingu@@ ish in the suspic@@ ion of racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you &apos;re writing at Fac@@ e@@ ook .
&quot; what should be done instead , carefully analyze the post and control it by checking out the words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( ages ) . &quot;
&quot; good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who are spreading hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who is spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative writing of cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; failed &quot; &quot; to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts made by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied po@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fac@@ ebooks &quot; &quot; automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; just to check out if Facebook removes the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to encourage violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the prolifer@@ ation of hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is an end with child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the child &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age @-@ effective age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , told the representatives of the various religious groups in the country , that the state should not interfere because that is , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this , despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as individuals under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children who were married to 15 was in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that stri@@ ves to aboli@@ sh rules for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and gr@@ ati@@ fied with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ n again , take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition war@@ med tensions in this un@@ complicated situation , and at some point , doubts came about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the child &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law pro@@ claim .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and nobody voted against it .
&quot; after being decre@@ ed before in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of the child had finally been changed .
&quot; Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , a Facebook member of the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and that &apos;s almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was happy that the day finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the legal age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for am@@ ending the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there were 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all MPs who were opposed have voted for the law .
the child &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ like tur@@ key .
thanks to all the activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; but a potential catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to call his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General in Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate elsewhere . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; rather Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only evoke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would simply talk about that the state , our daughters , are ab@@ used to them , that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ headed men who are in the benefit of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child &apos;s marriage in various levels is legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they are saying . &quot;

&quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is not Dim@@ on for you &quot; &quot; on the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office invites the citizens to not follow the pro@@ vocation and to keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor announced the local news service in Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia &apos;s content again . &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series resist the blocking .
&quot; although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocked by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was passed . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia sides on its de@@ centralized peer to peer network ( thus calcul@@ ating calcul@@ ators ) which is not based on the system of domain names , thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the illegal ban , the content is now available . &quot;
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after hearing the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put it all on to place snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help the users to view at least all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , when Wikipedia is banned in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you can access a different URL that is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if these are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
&quot; a su@@ h@@ len@@ der N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , N@@ ept@@ une tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home village right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard was on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the River dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started cra@@ ck@@ ling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he was facing tig@@ ers face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he sits right away , we look at us and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist shelter . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ pul@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should ignore the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of mentioning their wives also by name is also common among men . however , they have far less ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , became a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and is committed to the mining of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the coverage of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to HIV and AIDS infected people and manages this club .
she reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of the change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round was women , who did not call their hus@@ bands by their name . &quot;
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves .
&quot; the name of her hus@@ bands does not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom which they all have to be du@@ ly inde@@ b@@ ted and never questioned . &quot;
title : Has@@ sel@@ bl@@ att@@ .@@ ged
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not stop this is regarded as mal@@ ici@@ ously , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round .
&quot; initially , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on the name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women never allowed to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she ch@@ oked only before him during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the entire accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient bridge , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member opted to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
&quot; a husband of a participant was less comprehensible , and the situation started in violence . &quot;
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead that indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the Gal@@ ician red dot if he did it also . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped carrying him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip for each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties on our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ one @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes , the mor@@ ale associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini &apos;s own pair of cour@@ ty@@ ards ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into being : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
&quot; the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like h@@ ag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes , are at the end of a difficult to navigate river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

obes@@ e men will be dra@@ gged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Flickr , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of ab@@ duction of headed people for organ traff@@ icking , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to halt the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district Mil@@ ton , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; it gave the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could sof@@ ten gold or bring riches , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia declared the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on smooth headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who planned to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are goal of ritual attacks , the Muslim police war@@ med after the latest mur@@ der@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district Mil@@ ange , where the mur@@ ders took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police already follow the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the gl@@ amor@@ ous men .
&quot; the persecution and assass@@ ination of headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a on Facebook shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of which Moz@@ ambique faces : &quot;
&quot; I like CH@@ TE like E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT IS ashamed A country in which people would have shame to go to the street as they would be ashamed of the footage of a porn film , a nation in which people would walk honest pursu@@ its or even take their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald heads are hun@@ ted for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some were not able to miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter farm , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro Sap@@ ange and also the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald heads : &quot;
Muslim authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ der@@ ings of smooth @-@ headed people .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for life cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after he participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that required democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China still maintains calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to make a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment if the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway .
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government claimed that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were res@@ um@@ ed until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his arrest , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately rescue Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us on how she shared in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad stated that the Americans &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as to help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; announc@@ ing the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the news agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the message requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement by the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with interven@@ ing and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators , Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz introduced a resolution at the Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Czech Republic
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um invited China to provide Li@@ u an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to anyone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says on :
&quot; Canada calls for China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to free entry barriers to the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France ( Germany )
France &apos;s foreign ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France will ultimately record it . &quot;
Taiwan .
&quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on 27 June , and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on June 28 about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem foo@@ lish , as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one asked whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight in front of the officers , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ ble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re appears from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answer . &quot;
related questions he clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers of rational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to enligh@@ ten this point , as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; while An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points out concerning the criti@@ ques that one should start reading the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was a &quot; city &quot; rather than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he told Singapore , &quot; Be not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement as a leader of a growing generation . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really is associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review submitted the short@@ com@@ ings of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , to which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapur going back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as it plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , but do they not defend their city ? &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , above all , &quot; etc . but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices , recently , asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or home country ? &quot;
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question asked me most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is a pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard response : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook war@@ dly in anger if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that separates us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; it was so , when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we speak very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; there wouldn &apos;t be anything if you would change me , for example , with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first of all , being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be fun - just like the gentle , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence around the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that has par@@ o@@ ed the Jun@@ ta , who took power in 2014 and , despite its promise , restore the civil government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man , who tells about what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend makes . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was dealt 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists urged the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , especially as it is with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta domination . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these shots of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently followed in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision about important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and persons accused of having denied the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand makes a strict sense against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Most Maj@@ estic ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
&quot; one of the issues that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it even shows how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because supposedly &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Mu@@ ch@@ asia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was published first on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al District . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since Geor@@ gian @-@ abor@@ ic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ reservoir of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the districts amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty 5 @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
posts in English or German &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plant@@ ation of the Soviet Union have now abandoned the District .
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ kov@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite their el@@ dest daughter who lives in France Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A to her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything , &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
&quot; despite their relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia collap@@ sed simply ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a little while , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost its anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was little work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation eng@@ ages the end , a little boy ren@@ ews us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now persec@@ utes the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which are responsible for in@@ fertility in their lives . &quot;

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts &quot; Mig@@ rants on their long journey &quot;

&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink nose @-@ frame and gold coloured rings in ted@@ dy bears form . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for approx . 2.50 Dollar per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , tells the people in full small buses and from the top of the coast they begin to call : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you from Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey exhausted shots . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he respon@@ ds smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught how to prepare ch@@ ick@@ ens like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were taken up in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive to be sold .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to people with his wife and three children who wanted to sque@@ eze money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single instructor , offered to him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays , the travellers generally consult their teleph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud Grand@@ mother , she leaves her album with a lot of photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of their daughter with African hair care that she made a Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s sad while she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , click here &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in Western China , are forced to install spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which they instru@@ ct the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities also decided to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would detect and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control your home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme limits and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from In @-@ In @-@ China &quot; ( PASS ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen showed the residents random@@ ly to check if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of bon@@ dage through the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from In @-@ In @-@ China &quot; ( Do not want to do it ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which emerges from the fact that the software can record the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all governmental branches , authorities and affiliated organisations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office to operate their computers and communications devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , the authorities issued an order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ lov &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ish@@ ments for a whole range of other possible off@@ enses , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from within and from outside . &quot;
one who makes all honour to their name .
one that has sli@@ pped into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if the reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer , the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and all cry after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dis@@ solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth moves on the axis of un@@ hei@@ r . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the leader of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn apart from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it suff@@ iced to allow the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods sought @-@ for , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ff@@ ed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming down after the power supply stopped working in the district . &quot;
&quot; I broke through silence , crying out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice echo through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt courage@@ ous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed us to a glorious picture that filled my expectations fully and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it doesn &apos;t really interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have cried to you all the way to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; let me listen to how you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his du@@ bi@@ ous eyes focused on me .
and you trust really what to look into the eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was about my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father with him . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with him . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed movement is in my nose until today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was subjected to months . &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I define all details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I can immediately sit down without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell , and I went back to an old proven method of communication : beating the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell layer was a &quot; &quot; slain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently there was in none of the surrounding cells an expected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness don &apos;t allow me to recognize any distinctive facial expressions , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ?
all the answers connected his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled in the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be questioned .
&quot; thus the secret was lifted up : in order to protect the betra@@ yers and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land here ; it is a curse they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant conversation , &quot; in spite of the expressions given to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more wei@@ ght@@ less with your life than to join these day @-@ th@@ iev@@ es and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to rip as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cri@@ es .
&quot; give it the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with it , and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
during my first arrest I wondered if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still on the line .
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no favor at all , which is why it grab@@ bed an electrically charged stick . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my half naked body , lying on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family fled to flee their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , facing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning its ancient opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of speech by art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and according to his own statement , he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a particular reluc@@ tance against U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees from the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a human , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is fores@@ een for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a lowering hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose are primarily free of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jord@@ an@@ iens has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert evening . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which issue the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advoc@@ ate for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be just shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional sex or@@ ms by trained his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently so@@ aked woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who really should trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official extern@@ ally left . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours in 2016 reached its culmin@@ ation ; however , even more frigh@@ tening is that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have tried victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of internal violence can &quot; &quot; be held in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures , as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity , and is known not to shy away from topics that have long been tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is not able to separate his music , the full of explicit all@@ usions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , a man . &quot;
&quot; politics was de@@ vised , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the heart can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but there was only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ it , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ it , who later once again worked on behalf of the cali@@ phs , was openly able to write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier do this ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic realm , there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence agency established several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the reason they would have expressed criticism in social media critical to the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has turned M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner@@ most changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will engage in real and fundamental openness with the aid of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , spre@@ aders and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ers are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been passed over and from a period when armies from the west are mar@@ ched to the north @-@ east to force the Indi@@ genous inhabitants of the region to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could snap some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just visible .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a height of 18 meters was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; outw@@ ard@@ ly appearance and body care were seldom as important as in this story , as they help to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate job such as the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital city of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; at the same time , Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts stand against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current events are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain a training in hair@@ dressing tools instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only college in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : letters of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

the following article is the edited version of the article entitled &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , which encouraged young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa v@@ ection F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Internation@@ al@@ workshop , Congress Centre of the Federal Employment Agency ( BA ) , Nuremberg &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and were carrying weapons all around the clock , now have to re@@ integrate into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in the creation of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and would have to help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illas , to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write to the people who we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more need@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former milit@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&apos;@@ I &apos;d never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN @-@ camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Stiftung submitted to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC recru@@ ited themselves as they used it earlier to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior kid@@ n@@ apped me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cabin where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters are living ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; I suddenly realized the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry about war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; as a pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some F@@ ARC leaders joined a discussion group . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice benefited from the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster , and even hate humans with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comfor@@ ts me that all men - including those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest against their rights , and this is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC are now putting peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ um@@ ova and its first publication took place on the OC Media website .
&quot; gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reports of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a D@@ amo@@ del compl@@ ains about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community there hasn &apos;t just emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what happened currently in the Republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , when reports have been published that addressed the ab@@ duction , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ as@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspected que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear for her life , she finally moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ wife who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her up without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . so , he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the lap . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ yan : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ and@@ spot ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and eventually wo@@ ke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had received everything and started crying .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
&quot; OC Media : in which case , were you placed - in which of the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and placed me to the women . &quot;
for this I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some totally unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running on the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was just bad speech , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a sn@@ are around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a num@@ eric plate with a 95 minute drive under the window .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without registering myself , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plug@@ ged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you are in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you plug in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo theme . &quot;
&quot; some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements , I still carry in myself . &quot;
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really effort to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock out a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably charge their relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require proof of the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine said , there wouldn &apos;t be so many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were with@@ drawn . &quot;
&quot; until now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about that yet . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else could it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people , which belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already occurred in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I wore my hair forever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 I was already known in quite large , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the seri@@ ousness !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; , &quot; but in the end it was thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were but@@ ton@@ ed ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore skir@@ t jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never curved me even a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a saying of saying : &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is often said to be children , if they make funny about the sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never insul@@ ted me , never driven and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace remember ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - one could sense how the people in town began to change .
&quot; he who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped a type of refuge .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who wish to wis@@ ely turn you out of the mouth , that there are no gay men with them . &quot;
&quot; the ro@@ dents who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ins who , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live with men .
&quot; you know many think about transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now over a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ ral community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , marked by poverty and unemployment in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments when he had kind@@ led himself .
&quot; some people quickly made it easy to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i minority , and activists warn against the fact that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the part of the persecution by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas of land for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of tribes , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces are situated Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ rying the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and have 45 % university degrees . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; as a result of this , a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities and anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arabic workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their native Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women respond - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex still attracts cross@@ wise through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to the skin colour , on racism , on black women women , on black women women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists let silence be silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of racial @-@ motivated violence , which we are subjected to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind , which refer to both gender and skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alized creature in a historical perspective . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural assimil@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women in silence for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to rep@@ el them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds to a home and to differenti@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of w@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us .
&quot; Cl@@ emens a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book afri@@ cana , ur@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) says that we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; To@@ dd Reu@@ bold &apos;s contribution was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in Iraq over the past 7 years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water anymore , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work lies on persec@@ uted , little resp@@ ectable sub @-@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ative . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people affected .
&quot; a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena on account of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez didn &apos;t help . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back to her ad . &quot;
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever report an adver@@ t at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who are mi@@ stre@@ ated . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence , in general meeting the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; article 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that contains nothing in accordance with the laws of Paraguay : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are however alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , the district prosec@@ utor &apos;s office received 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace cases . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; to every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay due to psych@@ ic abuse notification , 9 women do not do this . &quot;
&quot; for every woman who ref@@ unds charges due to physical abuse , two women who do not do this , they declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ense , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s genocide in the country . &quot;
the ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violent acts by men . &quot;

&quot; un@@ seen abuse and a legal system , which does not under@@ mine &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . however , she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence for two years - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognis@@ able : &quot;
I had never thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that the victims of abuse would have at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vic@@ tori@@ as case , everything began with psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
&quot; Vic@@ tori@@ as &apos;s view of the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good Appro@@ ach to Po@@ ver@@ ty Re@@ alisation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ registered ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that femin@@ ists agree to an independent criminal record and pun@@ ish them harder , as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the wording of the law was changed in some points to win even the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was denied , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to pay the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to report an adver@@ t and get a safe accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
&quot; however , Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , ill treatment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will be offen@@ ded . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , some parts of the law had been changed , among other things , a passage of passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a big set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continued to attack targets one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been banned because of a decision made by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the United Arab authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sul@@ tan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dism@@ issed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sul@@ tan , he suffers the most important mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Command of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of Sul@@ tan is characterized by the persist@@ ence of security forces , especially of the secret intelligence service , public liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack against the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closing and the imprisonment of three of her editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested , after the paper published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Level Parties to the Justice &quot; on 26 July 2016 . therein , there was corruption in the judicial system and the interference of senior officials in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was charged from the ISS in front of the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS captured the deputy chief @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information announced the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted , among other things , due to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a prohibition of publication and s@@ lan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j have been sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of each 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; a network of information for dissemin@@ ating material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court released Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month sentence from prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he is serving his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Chamber also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was renewed for three additional months , and with which the Minister added another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman at recent times .
&quot; further injuries include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Nig@@ eri@@ an authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman disp@@ ose of their legitimate human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial le@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have much more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment to research these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping develop its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Dis@@ eases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier @-@ RW : at the moment , the main focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Tun@@ isian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; I was also launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GV : what do you think about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being a mach@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or withdraw , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only make articles available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s contribution was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems around the world . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get , limits set . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only suitable for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eals or car@@ rot varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but he needs more time since his work is becoming more and more difficult . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to d@@ ull .
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT field and not from the realm of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , providing alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit themselves to be able to freely use the seeds they were bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders simply allow others who purchase their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties , and not immediately to sow - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the accredited professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in greater co@@ hesi@@ on , such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; &quot; says he and takes on the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep other their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available genetic pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SS@@ I , dealt with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are not such estim@@ ations yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass planted crops such as wheat have been patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a Question of View
&quot; plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from such , by which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder will take more and more patents . at the moment , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the notion that intellectual property has other gro@@ wer cabinets since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ ries promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection does not in@@ hibit innovations , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders don &apos;t have the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their job easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton is bot@@ her@@ ed by the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics itself . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds also its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to grow her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly contrary . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it creates most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding farm .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also convinced that bre@@ eder would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce new things , more than a company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years from competition , with which you can make it quite easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance &quot;
&quot; although the United States seems to be a leader in open source , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also helps them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ da is working on an Open Source License , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot be adopted simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; an explanation , however , is not a law ; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled launch next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development assistance groups ( among them Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report . &quot;
&quot; the report will also highlight the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon recognise him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clearer that there is more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the same . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities were deeply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains stuck in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should actually defend the law , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted in order to overcome the blocking and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on continuing to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months , including the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of wave of web side barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ .@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada made use of his blog for the spread of articles and articles he has written for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ &apos;s blog is located , on the other hand is accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercise physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s block@@ ade and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to ban blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ ay@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; they managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of si@@ ege ; an arrest , a temp@@ ting murder , ou@@ tre@@ ach at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it for the position of articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courage@@ ous go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from 24 May to 06 August . this revealed technical tests on networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , through the enclosure of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of websites offered by V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
&quot; such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content , which could have access to Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day newspapers all over Brazil report in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old school@@ ed in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day is killed a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO global justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published the editorial &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , is not normal in which it announced to set up a new category called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper says the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens from civili@@ sed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a cause for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist in the paper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial article , the newspaper continues : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ courses if it is distor@@ ted can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; do more than it har@@ ms ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as evi@@ den@@ ced by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of the public service . &quot;
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mortality rates per state , Rio is located in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; to these security measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , was to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ed a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . for some years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ans and repres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war poses grave consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war . this includes intru@@ sion into the territory of an &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; where a zi@@ pper is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; blocked spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; one week later , the police took up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

link : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Council PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and surrounding Syria , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime based on studies conducted by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to the fact that local inhabitants had to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and co @-@ operate the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional food in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive nutritional source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , subscription Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it is gaining more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ but will continue to collect donations to c@@ ando on Monday 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices announced that they started &quot; production from the regions of mush@@ room seeds , &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mush@@ room farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach the people mush@@ room breeding for various reasons : breaking of the si@@ ege .
provision of a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities which are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be seen . &quot;
&quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis regions , and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
&quot; several hundred people were prot@@ esting on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal , demanding justice for the victims of fires that were bur@@ sting in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
&quot; bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region of Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the wood@@ land areas by satellite ima@@ gery , in 2017 alone 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos are spread in the web and show pictures that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ - and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Government of the farmers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
&quot; after ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits are questioned with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val carries out in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , were spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , after bran@@ ching of this species . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence Community of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as citizens seeking information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and became so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , so that the server did not resist the influ@@ x of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , was one of the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the Province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t tell it at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; at dawn , the boy was to break . &quot;
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .
the town of G@@ haz@@ ni in Afghanistan .

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ election , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt protected . &quot;
the Taliban @-@ known Taliban were ever closer to their hatred for the Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in direction to Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his modest wage , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mor@@ tar that were he@@ avier than himself to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af reminded himself in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in an empty building on site where we worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we were not freezing at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous voyage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high alarm quot@@ as , but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers have in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommodated in the more than 3,000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his fierce li@@ fest@@ y@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions , soon . &quot;
&quot; after having done several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af has put all its savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now a theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a hazard in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including cutting firms , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen personnel were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pa@@ dua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and are aiming to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily , if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end , stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen Report : Egypt &apos;s bill of bills allow Ab@@ use of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo that prot@@ ested against the dism@@ iss@@ al of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament scrut@@ ini@@ zes a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
&quot; users must register to use social networks , register within six months of successful legislative decision on the Authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or tri@@ ple@@ tion of a penalty payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which the tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high official . &quot;
&quot; under the law of law , the assass@@ ination of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law proposition , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would mean a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years . &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 demonstr@@ ators , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison leadership failed to put the accused of jail in the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ possession , illegal gathering , murder and an attempt to murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iza spoke about the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si Se@@ at block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ ic activ@@ ist to inter@@ ro@@ gate documents
&quot; in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was basically inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated to a mess@@ ed action plan . said Plan comes from the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial bill , which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they give back all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ ist website , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources by stating Articles 11 of the Tun@@ isian Press Code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the case of the district court in Tunis on 9th May . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within social networks . it is now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens proposed in social media to impose these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; then , let &apos;s look at &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , Russia &apos;s state cens@@ orship blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as &quot; organizer of dissemination of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government conduc@@ ts a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites belong to websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ bl@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish Court has Sper@@ ling Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the information , Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was locked because it became &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to join a political de@@ bac@@ le campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
United Kingdom cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; following this week , the UK government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance needs , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and install back@@ door programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telec@@ oms and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has om@@ itted other technology companies and the civilian population extern@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; despite this , the consultation continues until May 19 . responses and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
