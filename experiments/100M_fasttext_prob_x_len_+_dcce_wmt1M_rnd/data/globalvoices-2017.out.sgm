<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, watched American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who was tasked with the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was it as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country I have ever lived, its diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm letter of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly denies his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in flocks for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps didn't agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix sun at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also contrary to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump was making his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"setting up people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act and think differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm. D.): as much as" Resolutions of the White against all the other ethnicities "; Worship of white in reference to the White and Whiplash, as the big Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has done so magnificently."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas offering this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd poured out."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out and their voices became louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a coherent and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan agreed with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, it is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Turkey's land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province with the children of the Paraguaean city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music that is played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, very popular among tourists, but worlds away from nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, the La banda de m√∫sica (music bande) plays in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the turkey you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, maple, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the kids of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the largest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recovered instruments made of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Ch√°vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura reminds itself of the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place at which the parents worked in rubbish. the kids didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them didn't live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin produced from trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra that plays instruments of recovered material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship already had illegal fishing in the liberian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The eastern african countries were raised accordingly and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were mobilised swiftly against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries which you simply refused to do," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing) in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries which at that time had driven the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up for each other, where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, why it is extremely difficult to detect. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and even through the snail empo to communicate with the information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, suspicious travel routes can be discovered - such as suggesting that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish fanfare, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm committed to fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, losing the eight members of HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen who invade East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world. among these illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include activities like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-coherent control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say" "You can't start my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front functions."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 vessels of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread falsified licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found refuge ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that love to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that combines different levels of information. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">"however, FISH-i's team of African nations can indeed influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?"</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes it."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Environment Agency Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data, and can be viewed worldwide via the position of every trackable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detract criminals, but also terrify them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, who had previously been fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know they are being watched."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i are now experiencing a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since fisher boats buy more licenses since then."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i had helped Somalia detecting Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together to join the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also combat the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state could report its first major triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship running under false flag. and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they were going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok. for so my father had educated me.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small box wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lumps of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I approached and saw a couch, where people were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cot and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bound a man with handcuffs to the bed, overcast him with water and hunted him into the genitals for 220 volts."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a filthy Winder.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same odor came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately realized the smell again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew those people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied and bound with handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose L√≥pez, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses where naked people were lying with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people were silent on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you see, Arschloch?" ""</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you bring me back?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew those people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my dad told me about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">"besides La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you can see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the order from the top came that they were to be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'warmute'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "wartime" - as they called it - was.</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered," "And you who stole cars on the streets?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still took home clothes."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence, a conspirator accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="295">"well, you have thus executed people during the dictatorship. but why do the corpses disappear?"</seg>

<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could easily have put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families with whom to surrender their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last disgusting act that one can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="308">Only to clarify it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities that I had to witness in his account.</seg>

<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that older people felt insulted by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," said the police. "</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for overlaying, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge in order to understand the original text and active language skills in order to transfer him to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translator in the target language - should not be in the original language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who have no foreign employees, can still make translations into their own. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the proverted and puzzling sentences, which are created by machine translation, show that this technique can not substitute for a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors like jewelry still acceptable, or at least harmless. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her minderold son or her minderold daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to afford a countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay, due to the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke to Criaditas, especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - Collected witness statements, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated against the Criadita guarantees in general silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they can conclude their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "is handed over to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family, who takes up the girl with himself and justifies his exploitation by faith, is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even starve."</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>

<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time so that she still remained for learning."</seg>
<seg id="462">It stood every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"Fridays, for example, cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more they were done with learning, the more free time it had."</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty-five Egyptian parliamentsmen recently voted in a draft law on" "regulators regarding use and use of social networks." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt need to register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application that is running and used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video directing and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, since the draft cannot indicate how Egyptian authorities are able to impose the registration on their users. unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyadh Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and editor of the bill of legislation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users of the Ministry of Telecommunications received a username and password to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to build a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of them, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not yet been known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "senior research technologist" ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning matters related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed at Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense control is maximized and ensured that no diverging scar is present on the surface," "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeast Japan, documented the progress made in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima have sparked the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was an etectable prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefecture of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had caused whole coastal cities to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"even more, the Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, already alone that alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the lives of the local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The report provides detailed comparative data on the number of deals and their value categorized into deal types and sub-sector.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitutions were completed (saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, one still tries, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by shelters (" "kasetsu juutaku)" "in final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the people from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuation raised after the disaster in homes of homes were resettled in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing ports in Fukushima have resumed its operation."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farmland of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear blackout zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains largely depressed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper produced numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation centres."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung comments:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness to the worst, catastrophic event, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 people from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled in permanent replacement homes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuees, who still live in shelters, are older than 50 years old. it is well known because efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after all, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were unbearable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories producing sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have brought mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop concludes that the young participants discuss topics like" cultural identity, speech, debate, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the School'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a street section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always speak of the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who sent them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes before almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance to the entrance to shokugo sanpuru (" "plastic models of the dishes" ") are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they won't notice them even more. however, a new trend nowadays turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokugo sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic ribbed mobile belts as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new Boom of Essentials is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile telephones and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon deceived?. "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also friction balls (onigiri), earrings and hand tapes of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"for more scurrile plastic dishes, you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, which means it's suire $suire code."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the misses and feedbacks appear regularly only in statistics. however, these do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzm√°n, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely against the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the communities that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone finds in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the digital project" Aprila Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with drug trafficking ") that will give these victims a voice and stories of people who came into battle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Pol√≠tico describes the project in this way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only allows us to be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>

<seg id="772">"where shall we get it?" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprila vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a lesbian of Animal Pol√≠tico wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with the disease and sentimation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come across newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin is thinking that he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it's not normal for people to hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of offenders if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is as if they are ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the nonviolence of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were" "possessions". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to be persuaded that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family has been plundered by threats for month. "in this, it describes how armed criminals pressured the money from their business for month until they were not only destroying their business, but also torn their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will be kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I wondered if weeping would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega released the article" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Ju√°rez: a Generation of Violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the verge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and" "Chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who was shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born as Bryan, the situation in Ju√°rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Ju√°rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor named 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 deaths per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprging a Vivir Con El Narco "Animal Pol√≠tico 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to explain the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted in a figurative way."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling Initiative (TLS), the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices report recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of cities in large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces, in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be part of."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening to this often is connected to" "understanding" "these events instead" listening to appreciate, to make sense. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, story tellers will first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their presentation lead to the audience."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional Burkina Faso story, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konad also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narration typical to her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nymusara tells the fabel from the rabbit and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his Fabel, John Nymusara is asked:" how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>

<seg id="1151">You were aware...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started at the Puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Col√≥n in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditor√≠a de la Deuda" (front for the re-examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reconstitution of debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Ricos demands that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial auditing and an executive committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction there is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what are the real costs associated with this."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra Prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra Prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the" "military police Bassel" "had taken part as a" "strictly secret" "command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it had been contacted by people on November 12, 2015 who presided themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and state remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels was more pretentious than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the hub of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to make this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a Promisuch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015, when he was imprisoned."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked on the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"at the same time, Mosambique reacted with anger against corruption in which a government member returned to the State apparatus after half of his sentence of imprisonment on which corruption was perpetrated."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 together with four other defendants, due to invariance of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was provided by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement issued by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume its old post since the company did not undergo disciplinary procedure after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade P√∫blica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>

<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the opposing character.</seg>

<seg id="1265">"Eg√≠dio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "disgusting" ":"</seg>

<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches; he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but as he is incompetent, he has unanimously approved to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself only by the state."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is normally used to refer to East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censuses the word" "Kalar" "or" "Kalar" "(in Burma) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely distorted connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today Kalar is normally associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have voiced doubt for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmesan words with fundamental meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written on Burmesan 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facullabia Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "Healing" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles a racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will lessen the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before all the Posts extinguish in the suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you're writing at Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what should be done instead, carefully analyze the post and control it by checking out the words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "(ages)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"good is that these dirty nationalists, who are spreading hate speech, get a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who is spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative writing of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post" "failed" "to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts made by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>

<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>

<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft bill against the child's marriage was decided - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim.</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technology-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocked by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet law (No. 5651) was passed."</seg>

<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia sides on its decentralized peer to peer network (thus calculating calculators) which is not based on the system of domain names, thus making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after hearing the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put it all on to place snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner."</seg>

<seg id="1405">"IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune tries to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his home village right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard was on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The River damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the leopard was located and I immediately started crackling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so fearful as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he was facing tigers face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he sits right away, we look at us and he stares at me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "I click for conservation". ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist shelter."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalypula and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Many parts of India avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should ignore the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of mentioning their wives also by name is also common among men. however, they have far less admittances to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, became a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and is committed to the mining of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the coverage of practices such as children's marriage to HIV and AIDS infected people and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in its discussion round was women, who did not call their husbands by their name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the name of her husbands does not speak loudly, is a custom which they all have to be duly indebted and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Title: Hasselblatt.ged</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not stop this is regarded as maliciously, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"initially, Rohini, who had never called her husband on the name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition where married women never allowed to speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she choked only before him during the whole exercise; another decided to release the entire accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient bridge, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member opted to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">"a husband of a participant was less comprehensible, and the situation started in violence."</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinnoberred point on the forehead that indicates the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the Galician red dot if he did it also."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip for each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities on our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salone-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, the morale associated with the Saris and much more, Rohini's own pair of courtyards (upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into being:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only made small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes, are at the end of a difficult to navigate river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">"the correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India, and make videos about stories that are not reported."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news of those who experience it themselves, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for life cancer at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(state threat) after he participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that required democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" an internal matter "and told a spokesman, he considered it" not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China still maintains calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him to make a treatment abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem foolish, as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" twist logic "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight in front of the officers, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries "in the face of this, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre appears from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answer."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions he cloaked with non-answers of rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to enlighten this point, as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"while Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points out concerning the critiques that one should start reading the entire co-ordinance of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was a" city "rather than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he told Singapore," Be not a country, "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes such a polemic statement as a leader of a growing generation."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really is associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review submitted the shortcomings of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "faithfully commit a mistake" "or was it a Freudian advocate?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, to which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapur going back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as it plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, but do they not defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade for Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, above all, "etc. but that is not quite correct."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017 and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink nose-frame and gold coloured rings in teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approx. 2.50 Dollar per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez, tells the people in full small buses and from the top of the coast they begin to call:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication they can't pay, she massaging them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey exhausted shots."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastian travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans speak to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ram√≠rez in future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he responds smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ram√≠rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught how to prepare chickens like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ram√≠rez is well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes√∫s Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family were taken up in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive to be sold.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he fled to people with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single instructor, offered to him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the passageways, the travellers generally consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ram√≠rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud Grandmother, she leaves her album with a lot of photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of their daughter with African hair care that she made a Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users, click here"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in Western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Clean ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities also decided to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would detect and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control your home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while notifications about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit disturbances and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme limits and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet abstentions."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter-based media outlet" Images from In-In-China "(PASS), the censored news published in China showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen showed the residents randomly to check if they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage through the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from In-In-China" (Do not want to do it) also published a Jingwang product description, which emerges from the fact that the software can record the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all governmental branches, authorities and affiliated organisations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office to operate their computers and communications devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an order to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the rights of Urumlov's three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole range of other possible offenses, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1999">"but if the reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer, the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood, and all cry after death."</seg>

<seg id="2008">"I broke through silence, crying out several times" Allahu Akbar "from my house roof."</seg>

<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you liberate the mind from the lamp, but it doesn't really interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow you - nothing can give you back your voice, after you have cried to you all the way to the office of security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was lifted up: in order to protect the betrayers and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow vision of their world view."</seg>

<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a giant cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated while I was still on the line.</seg>

<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole district."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half naked body, lying on the ground, was the perfect conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room" "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my father must be fearful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>

<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slips to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family fled to flee their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist, facing the conservative majority and questioning its ancient opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of speech by art and rapeseed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and according to his own statement, he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a particular reluctance against U.S. foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees from the second generation, "he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I am a human, "while he pours in water Nescaf√© in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is foreseen for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a lowering hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose are primarily free of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordaniens has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert evening."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputies and former spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which issue the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be just shallow rhetoric, but actually a clear crystallizing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional sex orms by trained his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently soaked woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who really should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of" "Honour killings" "has increased in Jordan - the inofficial externally left."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honours in 2016 reached its culmination; however, even more frightening is that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have tried victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of internal violence can" "be held in prison for an indefinite period of time," "and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures, as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman has nothing to do."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity, and is known not to shy away from topics that have long been taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, the full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, a man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was devised," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the heart can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" "Santandano". ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words," what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but there was only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuit, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuit, who later once again worked on behalf of the caliphs, was openly able to write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier do this?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemitic realm, there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence agency established several former government officials and members of the teacher association, with the reason they would have expressed criticism in social media critical to the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has turned Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's what Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and innermost changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will engage in real and fundamental openness with the aid of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, spreaders and artificially-led democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriers are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the wagons, drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been passed over and from a period when armies from the west are marched to the north-east to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the article entitled "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo P√°rraga from the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la reconciliaci√≥n (letters to reconciliation), which encouraged young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla vection FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"Internationalworkshop, Congress Centre of the Federal Employment Agency (BA), Nuremberg"</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and were carrying weapons all around the clock, now have to reintegrate into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred to guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in the creation of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillas, to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write to the people who we love, on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more needful."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former militants of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I'd never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN-camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Stiftung submitted to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC recruited themselves as they used it earlier to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said the political student Manuela Jim√©nez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior kidnapped me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of cabin where the guerrilla fighters are living), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do you do?" "he replied," "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." I suddenly realized the tears over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry about war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"so far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"as a prelude, students and some FARC leaders joined a discussion group."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice benefited from the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster, and even hate humans with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - including those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the camp commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cali, the Archbishop of Cali:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest against their rights, and this is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC are now putting peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reports of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damodel complains about the LGBTQ community there hasn't just emerged overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what happened currently in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago, when reports have been published that addressed the abduction, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milasina in Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspected queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after experiencing a group of Chechens from the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear for her life, she finally moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwife who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her up without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. so, he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no men in Chechnya who can remove that disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents by the whole WhatsApp made the lap."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnyan:" how long do you want to dishonour the family, you scandspot? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which case, were you placed - in which of the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and placed me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some totally unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running on the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family, but the whole Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a snare around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a numeric plate with a 95 minute drive under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering myself, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe, you are in security just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you plug in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality, this is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditional Caucasian elements, I still carry in myself."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really effort to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock out a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably charge their relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require proof of the so-called" honour "through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine said, there wouldn't be so many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped from their relatives to face Kadyrows's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged in order to radicalize themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were withdrawn."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about that yet. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, which belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already occurred in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I wore my hair forever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003 I was already known in quite large, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the seriousness!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was applied, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to introduce us to" "Civilization", "but in the end it was thrown back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were buttoned; I had colored eyelashes, wore skirt jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never curved me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechnya language there is a saying of saying:" "Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to be children, if they make funny about the sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never insulted me, never driven and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace remember?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how the people in town began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who laughed and laughed, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clapped a type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature is, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as Chechens, who wish to wisely turn you out of the mouth, that there are no gay men with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the rodents who have the Cabardins who, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking into the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now over a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in self-murder within the impoverished Arab ancestral community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, marked by poverty and unemployment in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments when he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly made it easy to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahraazi minority, and activists warn against the fact that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month a few others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who were helpless and unable to feed their families on the part of the persecution by the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas of land for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privations."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of tribes, the water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces are situated Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worrying the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed the primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and have 45% university degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among the young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"as a result of this, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities and anti-Arab discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arabic workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their native Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first name and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi, because even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahavazi have to endure, human rights activist Alarm beat before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and becoming aware of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, also with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Photo taken by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afrof√©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women respond - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex still attracts crosswise through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer twice and threefold."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to the skin colour, on racism, on black women women, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists let silence be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices and sing "Kumbaya, my lord," to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racial-motivated violence, which we are subjected to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">Women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refer to both gender and skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanly and marginalized creature in a historical perspective."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural assimilation in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women in silence for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to repel them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds to a home and to differentiate themselves from the white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of womanism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clemens a Hudson-Weems, the author of the book africana, uranism: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) says that we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"Todd Reubold's contribution was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again Nabil Musa traveled in Iraq over the past 7 years, mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "Musa says."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeeper Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water anymore, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of their work lies on persecuted, little respectable sub-cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with which help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguays women and their difficult struggle against violence</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by curative. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# softereinefraubin) reported on violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police Commissioner said Ada B√°ez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena on account of mistreatment, the acute indication of Ada B√°ez didn't help."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved back to her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever report an advert at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who are mistreated. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to be victims of violence, in general meeting the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"article 1 Strikes and Statistic 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system that contains nothing in accordance with the laws of Paraguay: good approach, flawed implementation of punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the district prosecutor's office received 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace cases."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed." "to every woman who is refunded in Paraguay due to psychic abuse notification, 9 women do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"for every woman who refunds charges due to physical abuse, two women who do not do this, they declared at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offense, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"until August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The ordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violent acts by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">A sign with the inscription: "without complicity." photo by Jessie Insfran P√©rez. use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2504">"unseen abuse and a legal system, which does not undermine"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Br√≠tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should be regretted for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. however, she endured psychic violence for two years - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recognisable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I had never thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as though they wanted to say that the victims of abuse would have at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was mistreated her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research carried out on site: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment to research these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping develop its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S√°bian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier-RW: at the moment, the main focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Tunisian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"I was also launching a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostics tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being a macher."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does finance and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or withdraw, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines can only make articles available for payment (the so-called" "paywall" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's contribution was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own imagination and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get, limits set."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only suitable for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or carrot varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he needs more time since his work is becoming more and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to dull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and strives to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and eaten red Roman salad of the variety Outredx in the" "glasshouse" "of the station. there it is tested, whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT field and not from the realm of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" open source "seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, providing alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to be able to freely use the seeds they were bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "breeders simply allow others who purchase their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties, and not immediately to sow - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the accredited professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in greater cohesion, such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," "says he and takes on the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agricultural industry."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep other their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available genetic pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, dealt with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are not such estimations yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass planted crops such as wheat have been patented in an even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of View</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from such, by which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder will take more and more patents. at the moment, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property has other grower cabinets since" patents and the protection of plant varietries promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovations, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" independent plant breeders don't have the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is bothered by the concept of patented plant characteristics:" we don't really create the characteristics itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "he who breeds a variety breeds also its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to grow herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly contrary. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it creates most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding farm.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also convinced that breeder would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce new things, more than a company that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years", "he says." with a patent you are protected for 20 years from competition, with which you can make it quite easy in my opinion. "worldwide resonance"</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the United States seems to be a leader in open source, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agreda is working on an Open Source License, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot be adopted simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"an explanation, however, is not a law; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for" open source "seed systems for the scheduled launch next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development assistance groups (among them Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report will also highlight the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon recognise him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clearer that there is more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship targets in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the same."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities were deeply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains stuck in spite of this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, which should actually defend the law, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted in order to overcome the blocking and not to give up. we insist on continuing to fulfill our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months, including the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada made use of his blog for the spread of articles and articles he has written for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he established to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, was even the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider with which also Zi's blog is located, on the other hand is accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police exercise physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blockade and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to ban blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelaytah al-Sisi's priority; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"they managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, a tempting murder, outreach at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I didn't write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, although only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it for the position of articles to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from 24 May to 06 August. this revealed technical tests on networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, through the enclosure of internet censorship and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of websites offered by VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content, which could have access to Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will they attack next?</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers all over Brazil report in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old schooled in school," "Every second day is killed a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO global justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" Extra "published the editorial" Extra "on August 16, published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, is not normal in which it announced to set up a new category called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper says the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens from civilised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a cause for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist in the paper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial article, the newspaper continues:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourses if it is distorted can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" do more than it harms?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cec√≠lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues against violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as evidenced by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public service."</seg>

<seg id="2780">"in addition to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, such as Cec√≠lia, has been repeating the security policy of the state for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"to these security measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Pol√≠cia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, was to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationed a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. for some years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chicans and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist Jo√£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war poses grave consequences for people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war. this includes intrusion into the territory of an" "enemy" "where a zipper is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" blocked spheres. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war, or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Council PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding Syria, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime based on studies conducted by the United Nations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under siege, which led to the fact that local inhabitants had to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and checkpoints."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and co-operate the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to conventional food in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive nutritional source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the project, subscription Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it is gaining more and more prominence."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 ‚Ç¨but will continue to collect donations to cando on Monday 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ¬∞ C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices announced that they started" production from the regions of mushroom seeds, "before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">"now they have designed a" "educational farm for the region". ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons: breaking of the siege.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people were protesting on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal, demanding justice for the victims of fires that were bursting in the north of Portugal in the week before."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"brandies were also registered in the Galicia region of Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedr√≥g√£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the woodland areas by satellite imagery, in 2017 alone 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," Jo√£o Sorval carries out in the same article of the newspaper P√∫blico.

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in direction to Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his modest wage, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf reminded himself in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan Refugees) lived in an empty building on site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we were not freezing at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous voyage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high alarm quotas, but it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3,000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unbiased personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">"but his fierce lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions, soon."</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having done several years of work in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf has put all its savings into the creation of a hostel in Venice."</seg>

<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of Afghans have emerged, including cutting firms, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
