this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he had spectac@@ ularly published that the N@@ SA heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courage@@ ous ones they are giving . &quot;
&quot; so when the government came to Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ por@@ ters already did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they have been indications that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were abandoned at cra@@ cks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can hide more and more .
&quot; instead of failure and cra@@ cking to statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , his teleph@@ ony secretly kept secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , his loan agreement , and even rice @-@ wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology has allowed the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do it from the moment they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet fame , which was originally developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology partners , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a chance to reveal mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental assistant , which suggests an alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall street @-@ insi@@ der warned us ahead of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data base in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and suspic@@ ious &#93; &#91; we b@@ ade Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness by an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous undertaking . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has brief@@ ed companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agency killer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and veil their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it to myself like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these don@@ il@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is happening . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to create a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible do@@ cks .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African Minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shock@@ ed us that all except one lawyer made suggestions for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covered investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very bad as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing ever changed ; as if there was always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a safe optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen advances towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been included in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both Houses of Parliament , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lights .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this type of in@@ transparency by laws .
&quot; together we can finally stop the in@@ transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I made an outlet sales . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; A@@ sh , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I swal@@ lowed up ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger s@@ sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sh@@ ud@@ dering on to@@ es to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he had bought from me today hangs in his class room . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold as strangers in childhood , actually friends who just waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ready , my ro@@ om@@ mates are pulling out and the rent will be increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a work desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
&quot; posts : 2,@@ 3@@ 63 &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress on wooden floor for 20 dollars .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham @-@ sco@@ ops ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept from it .
&quot; we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a site where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can then invite other people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in dwell@@ ings of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you don &apos;t mind the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your cell phone .
enter your unlock mobile phone to your left seating neighbour .
this quiet approach of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your cell phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just like that , who now actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling to the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name , when he told him where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really cling very well un@@ locked phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to dism@@ iss negative assessments .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their reviews before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we entr@@ ust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ disposition .
it will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through judgments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation har@@ ms common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ dil@@ ections .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces down .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need previously un@@ covered .
&quot; for us , business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; I stood at the forefront , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the nights im@@ par@@ ted by the 123 million nights had a problem . &quot;
for people trusted one another rightly .
&quot; when trust works , mira@@ culous can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save lives , although they don &apos;t know it right at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; but now simply call it &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people lay a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , it is comparable to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if vo@@ y@@ ages were a rich buffet made of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you attended , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l quarter of which you have never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of sharing the common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay , &quot;
&quot; were taught to people whose children were exp@@ elled , and incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . via our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger , or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites to us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
posts in English or German &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about it every time , when a red Maz@@ da goes past me . &quot;
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; subjected to or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the check @-@ in at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : Americans think , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met any Muslims , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ st . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was that at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to make me a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; it was trust and slow devotion , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Koran . &quot;
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to we@@ eping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I was later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start building . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we drove in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and when I heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national islam@@ ic organizations saying , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Do not rejoice . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were considered to be Muslims in the Free Zone and suggested . &quot;
there were really fires on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
&quot; I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can indeed hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ s@@ th@@ el@@ fers and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror . &quot;
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to view people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant and show greater citizen participation .
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington area recently told me , people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation , one has noticed that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the terrorists to be the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still say that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they don &apos;t exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only be in trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that gave her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m her@@ al@@ ded the connection with God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , kept her from joining the IS . &quot;
this was an insight how Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect normal American people ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , con@@ formance and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; one study shows : if you submit messages to test persons in which negative was reported on Muslims , they rather agree with military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you see when the mood against Muslims shot above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can indeed be a tool for manipulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we feel it perhaps the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his ré@@ sum@@ é . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did the young man become such an accomplished young man , out of my brother ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was visited in the afternoon . &quot;
he flow@@ ed eight times to De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mos@@ que or are we sure to stay at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we would leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child seat , we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and went out my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked them and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ talk , a thin@@ ker with draft , work in a cl@@ assy mind factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception to rule appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for b@@ ast@@ ers , is about to become a multi @-@ billion dollar store . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air package delivery into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines built in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flight devices , flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build resili@@ ent structures independently .
&quot; they have learned to bear bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence and in general react to natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possi@@ bil@@ ty in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to autonom@@ ously work , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ ep page . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
decades ago trained pilots could fly remote controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies with only one function .
&quot; this is the mono@@ winner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern rigid . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the chance to have it exactly right when all of you watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mono@@ winner is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the most important skill , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let us look at that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this revol@@ ves in c@@ lock@@ wise direction
and the other against c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half air@@ planes .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we accepted standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da dr@@ ills wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the wage is in development and the act of creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other more and more quickly , so the mass of three s@@ uns in a tenth of a second turned into pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not replace them in the form of light .
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in the first place .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly bold -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise e.g. through colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed the idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Gra@@ vit@@ ational Wave Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased considerably , which greatly improved detection performance . &quot;
this is why it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the detection of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes forced through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector too .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell of my to@@ d@@ dly father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and her observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ ut@@ ling in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pun@@ ched into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform a correctly al@@ ber@@ ing dance in courses on rel@@ ativity theory . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ched by us when hitting the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length should be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us exactly . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite handy , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in tones , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the universe speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity , can tell us a lot about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; sh : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like this : &quot; &quot; wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; wu @-@ wu @-@ wu &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render device &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to listen , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let us consider briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , cir@@ cling one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a whole new way to study the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ apped stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur however in the nucle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these are op@@ aque .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail light . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there are all things that we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes like Lig@@ o they are watching are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the creation of stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried out an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , eliminated my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life in an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; cookies &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; pussy , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked her once whether I could play with her , when I was on the leap . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I was trying to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very happy . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ ws for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think of things , aw@@ aken to life . &quot;

no .
I am a Titan .
porn @-@ Movie with Pin@@ a@@ Pop@@ p
I create television . I produce television .
&quot; I &apos;m doing television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series are running on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programmes that I have created , and not only produced , so even overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;

I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are going to run a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you can understand that I don &apos;t just dance on the computer and f@@ antasi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work is creating a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is when I ordered troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as if you have a high sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and rational . and the best thing is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums that I persu@@ ade them to write to me that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; do you not mis@@ understand me , it does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began working on television production , when I began to work and work and make , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can not seek differently from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of being unable to seek differently than to seek size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it means genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of a failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say that I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more you are watching , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the tot@@ e , the tot@@ e , the tot@@ e . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the tot@@ e .
am I only this sum ?
and then the sum stopped .
&quot; over@@ worked , over@@ stressed , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single labour force .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; Cookies , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ p ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was sil@@ enced .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my sum@@ p was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as usual : the same title work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview of Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the tot@@ e and the m@@ um was me .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; hire yourself , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do , you do , you do , you are working , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives one the summ@@ ation when you know the tot@@ e , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress is asking me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than two things become aware of :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and second , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot;
she calls nobody else &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I p@@ asse it when I &apos;m a Titan and enter my bo@@ g , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing but to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl lets in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working conditions , the titanium sums , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am if I &apos;m describing my brain using broad@@ casts and television and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real tot@@ e is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on the love .
&quot; the sum is the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from all debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play is not a way to play , as work . &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a human being rather than to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I mainly feel sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab@@ bed my mobile phone .
&quot; OK , now I just want BF@@ 1918 / 2 . &quot;
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the universe of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I wonder : why did we ever stop playing with the game ?
&quot; you can also do it ! always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replace me .
&quot; and talk to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , you don &apos;t need more . &quot;
everyone can take 15 minutes to play even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes at the play !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no dist@@ ra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children ready to go . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for his peace of mind . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
around the &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to excel myself more and more .
15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself for a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my free time . the hum@@ ming seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
now that is my sum .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the Sum@@ m@@ ary of Love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , trem@@ bling , naked and new feeling of life is wide . fewer Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel precisely this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think of things , I raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by different surgical interventions .
&quot; they have certainly heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered under severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
&quot; you have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells at the skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a , and the skull @-@ internal pressure rises . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , one sometimes needs to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
making cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , tiny niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are sharing very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why stay they get us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic realm , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then mark them color to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we reim@@ pl@@ ored them at the reception of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous tran@@ spl@@ ant -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we have to re @-@ plan these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ impl@@ ant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we re @-@ inv@@ ade the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we drove an injury and re @-@ inv@@ ent exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we missed the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it happened in humans , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover using plastic bra@@ ins . they can recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ ored his own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the monkeys that spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we reim@@ pl@@ an@@ ted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can free@@ ze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to impl@@ ant it to humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable d@@ rought .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved indisp@@ utable that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is dis@@ appearing with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance ministers in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group were wrong , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are swe@@ pt , our future glo@@ om , and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , which th@@ rows its long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognise his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , which , however , are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and produce income that could produce the debt level and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green energy . &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars that at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and to raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , like in a final loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors , which , as in a final loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally the circumstances lead to that Ö@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills it .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy ended up too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the H@@ ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they dealt with the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political co@@ determination with the same voting weight as questions of the state of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long .
&quot; like a candle that g@@ lows very bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , by gradually under@@ mining the politics and deprived them . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government , and yet not in power , because the power is stran@@ gled from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about as much as a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they feed themselves , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med the politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations increases , political goods are de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; democr@@ ats &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only regain a position like in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separated areas , automation will increase the twin peaks , the waste of wast@@ es , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is - very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance system that lets the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; appear as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix , &quot; &quot; similar to that in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; &quot; in which machines serve humans and people put their energy into the investigation of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we should be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples in brief . &quot;
&quot; in the company area : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one employer to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all the income from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour , is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; there is no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there who do not belong there . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately not a rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it wasn &apos;t the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ated in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global key@@ nesi@@ an . &quot;
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it more democratic . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the macro@@ economic demand , called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely ir@@ responsible . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have told you very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s perspective on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it is playing -- the area of economy -- is a totally democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
it was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now pre@@ fers to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself , sm@@ elling tremend@@ ously after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you see six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive de@@ valuation line went through the Eurozone , and continues to be massi@@ vely under threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its construction . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a minister of finance or any Minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claimed no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions going through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody from the Troika , who imposed this policy on us , stood : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the free@@ will forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not only result in dis@@ astro@@ us consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the road of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most , although he is probably responsible for 22 average minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior researcher at Amazon Studios ;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a fran@@ chise and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are all right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this evaluation is received .
&quot; when your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average expression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t enth@@ use them . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create achievements .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can look at everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases nothing in vain , one att@@ aches to it right ? &quot;
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they gather the data , process them and draw up the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it somewhat different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a contest , he and his team have looked at the available data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic says that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you hit , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we grab more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge is carried out or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will decide whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data of the most accomplished firms are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , they can predict -- through data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year around year , until it worked out suddenly no longer , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most accomplished firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer treatment &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I &apos;ve seen some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to hold a resolution . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a conclusion .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all own it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something where the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , then a good conclusion -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they otherwise could not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did so in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compet@@ ed for TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to avoid this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will be doing it later with a technique demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but as you of course know when you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that , despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
