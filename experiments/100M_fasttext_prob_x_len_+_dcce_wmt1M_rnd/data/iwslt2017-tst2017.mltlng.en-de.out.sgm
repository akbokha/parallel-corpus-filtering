<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he had spectacularly published that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they are giving."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came to Risen, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they have been indications that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were abandoned at cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can hide more and more.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and cracking to statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his understanding, his telephony secretly kept secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and bank information, his loan agreement, and even rice-wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do it from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet fame, which was originally developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology partners, such as Edward Snowden, have a chance to reveal misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental assistant, which suggests an alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a wall street-insider warned us ahead of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data base in history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that rich and suspicious] [we bade Robert Palmer of Global Witness by an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous undertaking. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has briefed companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency killer or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and veil their fortunes -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it to myself like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these donilds."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is happening."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information to give less information to create a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly susceptible docks.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African Minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one lawyer made suggestions for our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very bad as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing ever changed; as if there was always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a safe optimist, I see that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen advances towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been included in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both Houses of Parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, will be used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advocate to end this type of intransparency by laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally stop the intransparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I finished my design studies, I made an outlet sales."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"one voice in my head said," Ash, as please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what have I swallowed up?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger ssleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, shuddering on toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me today hangs in his class room. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold as strangers in childhood, actually friends who just waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ready, my roommates are pulling out and the rent will be increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a work desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">"posts: 2,363"</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress on wooden floor for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham-scoops tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to investors:" we want to create a site where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms whose doors one closes when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can then invite other people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in dwellings of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you don't mind the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone to your left seating neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your cell phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who now actually has Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling to the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name, when he told him where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really cling very well unlocked phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to dismiss negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their reviews before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we entrust the people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predisposition.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation harms common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted predilections.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices down.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need previously uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the forefront, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the nights imparted by the 123 million nights had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one another rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, miraculous can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels, who save lives, although they don't know it right at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay will expire."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply call it" "rental industry", "the thing will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of themselves, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is comparable to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if voyages were a rich buffet made of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you attended, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl quarter of which you have never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of sharing the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us society and relations, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children were expelled, and incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. via our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger, or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">Posts in English or German "</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I have to think about it every time, when a red Mazda goes past me."</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"subjected to or suppressed, a brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the check-in at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: Americans think, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met any Muslims, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga is singing, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to oust."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," "Why do you suppress yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old to make me a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">"it was trust and slow devotion, deepening with every reading of the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you fully understands you and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I got married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I was later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking news". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... ","... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start building."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we drove in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national islamic organizations saying," Be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Do not rejoice. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were considered to be Muslims in the Free Zone and suggested."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fires on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I don't have any questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can indeed hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfers and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces, but do not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to view people of other faiths more tolerant and show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington area recently told me, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalisation, one has noticed that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even by their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing that causes the terrorists to be the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still say that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they don't exaggerate what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only be in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists that gave her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam heralded the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing her for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, kept her from joining the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight how Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal American people?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows: if you submit messages to test persons in which negative was reported on Muslims, they rather agree with military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you see when the mood against Muslims shot above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Moslem terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we feel it perhaps the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the Faculty of Medicine, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his résumé. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did the young man become such an accomplished young man, out of my brother?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, which was visited in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He flowed eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or are we sure to stay at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we would leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat, we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and went out my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked them and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I ask myself, what do you say to those who might say you're holding a TEDtalk, a thinker with draft, work in a classy mind factory, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for basters, is about to become a multi-billion dollar store."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air package delivery into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting flight devices, flying machines achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build resilient structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and in general react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibilty in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to autonomously work, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweep page."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots could fly remote controlled flight devices that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with only one function.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monowinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and can move everywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern rigid. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the chance to have it exactly right when all of you watch me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monowinner is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the most important skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some are imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da drills wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in development and the act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes circled each other more and more quickly, so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second turned into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not replace them in the form of light.</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">"more than 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly bold -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves, which arise e.g. through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed the idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo increased considerably, which greatly improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detection of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes forced through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector too.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my toddly father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and her observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crutling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and punched into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers often perform a correctly albering dance in courses on relativity theory."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and punched by us when hitting the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus exactly. that is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, hunting for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite handy, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in tones, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the universe speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"sh: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very fast, one hears the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like this:" "wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu" "(" "wu-wu-wu" ")."</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender device] Somebody who knows what to listen, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a whole new way to study the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why mapped stars explode in super-novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur however in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own tail light."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"indeed, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes like Ligo they are watching are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo makes us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, on the creation of stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, eliminated my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes" "has changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life in an unexpected way. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all" cookies "for inexplicable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"pussy, I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked her once whether I could play with her, when I was on the leap. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I was trying to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very happy."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" saws for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think of things, awaken to life."</seg>

<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I'm doing television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programmes that I have created, and not only produced, so even overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world."</seg>

<seg id="598">"nobody, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>

<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, when the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are going to run a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so that you can understand that I don't just dance on the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not dreaming in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is creating a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is when I ordered troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you have a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational. and the best thing is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums that I persuade them to write to me that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"do you not misunderstand me, it does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began working on television production, when I began to work and work and make, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can not seek differently from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of being unable to seek differently than to seek size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of a failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say that I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more you are watching, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the tote, the tote, the tote."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the tote.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overworked, overstressed, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single labour force.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," "Cookies, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sump ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was silenced.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sump was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as usual: the same title work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview of Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just didn't have fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the tote and the mum was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "hire yourself, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do, you do, you do, you are working, one loves to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives one the summation when you know the tote, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress is asking me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says:" mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than two things become aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and second, she didn't call me" kittens. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls nobody else "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I passe it when I'm a Titan and enter my bog, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says:" "mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing but to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl lets in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"not immediately, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working conditions, the titanium sums, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am if I'm describing my brain using broadcasts and television and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real tote is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sum is the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real humming is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all debt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sum."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play is not a way to play, as work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a human being rather than to be at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grabbed my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">"OK, now I just want BF1918 / 2."</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the universe of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why did we ever stop playing with the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can also do it! always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you hold me for naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talk to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, you don't need more."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes to play even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children ready to go."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is true to feel the humming, to have a place for his peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to excel myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself for a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my free time. the humming seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summary of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum. the land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, trembling, naked and new feeling of life is wide. fewer Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel precisely this humming, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think of things, I raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have certainly heard of one of the most known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered under severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine that the brain swells at the skull-brain-traumata, and the skull-internal pressure rises."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one sometimes needs to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Making cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, tiny niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are sharing very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic realm, and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimplored them at the reception of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we have to re-plan these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we re-invade the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we drove an injury and re-invent exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of skill, we missed the motor skills range in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it happened in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover using plastic brains. they can recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implored his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the mplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant it to humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an immutable drought.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved indisputable that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is disappearing with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as finance ministers in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not the austerity programs that were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup were wrong, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are swept, our future gloom, and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin-summit Paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, which, however, are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and produce income that could produce the debt level and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example" green energy. ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and to raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, like in a final loop, advocates the pessimism of the investors, which, as in a final loop, could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally the circumstances lead to that Ödipus kills it.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy ended up too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of athenical democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Hathenic democracy was and is that they dealt with the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political codetermination with the same voting weight as questions of the state of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long.</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that glows very brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, by gradually undermining the politics and deprived them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government, and yet not in power, because the power is strangled from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about as much as a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals from which they feed themselves, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed the politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations increases, political goods are devalued, the macroeconomic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" democrats "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only regain a position like in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separated areas, automation will increase the twin peaks, the waste of wastes, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is - very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance system that lets the film" "matrix" "appear as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question, therefore, is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "matrix," "similar to that in" "Star Trek," "in which machines serve humans and people put their energy into the investigation of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we should be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples in brief."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the company area: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one employer to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all the income from capital and redeeming, and the concept of wage labour, is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"there is no distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there who do not belong there. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately not a rising twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy: please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging economies], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it wasn't the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, in particular against the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time liberated in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it more democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in the macroeconomic demand, called Larry Summers as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely irresponsible."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have told you very clearly what you think of the West's perspective on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it is playing -- the area of economy -- is a totally democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now prefers to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century itself, smelling tremendously after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you see six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive devaluation line went through the Eurozone, and continues to be massively under threat to the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its construction."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a minister of finance or any Minister, who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claimed no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought that there was an honest interest in the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions going through the Eurozone."</seg>

<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"it is worse than during the" "Great Depression". ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"nobody from the Troika, who imposed this policy on us, stood:" this was a colossal mistake. "</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most, although he is probably responsible for 22 average minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior researcher at Amazon Studios;</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a franchise and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are all right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this evaluation is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"when your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that make addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think one needs special intelligence to underline" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average expression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't enthuse them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is available, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can look at everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases nothing in vain, one attaches to it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they gather the data, process them and draw up the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7,5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it somewhat different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a contest, he and his team have looked at the available data on Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you hit, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is a little frightening because we live in a time when we grab more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge is carried out or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will decide whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of the most accomplished firms are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way, they can predict -- through data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year around year, until it worked out suddenly no longer,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most accomplished firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data unimaginably to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer treatment"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I've seen some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to hold a resolution."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all own it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something where the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete, then a good conclusion -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise could not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did so in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they competed for TV ideas when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to avoid this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be doing it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in hindsight on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but as you of course know when you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis, to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that, despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
