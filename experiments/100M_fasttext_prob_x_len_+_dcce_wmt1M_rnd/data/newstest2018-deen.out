Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t chapel where the S @-@ Bahn tunnels are excav@@ ated .
small labor@@ ers manage the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a walk @-@ in road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very revealing . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not recognized as such .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps were used for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ position sheets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian survey administration , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army chief occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : they were the current neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ Map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drive forward the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian mess@@ aging management . &quot;
the copyright sheet for Munich origin@@ ates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was registered 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in the outw@@ ard zo@@ oming a small @-@ part card appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered flags from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; judgment &quot; &quot; from which the corner@@ stone was derived . &quot;
small plots do not show farmers there today - but small farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sonne . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ma@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ties &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden directed the establishment - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the Ank@@ le of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use force against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later on 500 places were extended . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power station in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ i@@ atri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was erected - in architectural all@@ usion to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered as &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bombs of the Al@@ lies opened many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days took place and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
with the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizen rights group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ours issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention while travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents have recently been found throughout the state and noted here . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who are dispro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people pass . &quot;
&quot; they will be stopped because of their skin color , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear gri@@ ev@@ ances in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group zi@@ pped incidents like rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during his journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , which shows that the black motor@@ ists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be prepared to bring it Cau@@ tion , or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI , the Hass@@ an Cri@@ mes Report , which states the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
&quot; travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company about housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after countries passed immigration laws to arrest local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration infrin@@ gements , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
femin@@ ist project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the members of the CD@@ U members Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have captured a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the rectangular courtyard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Local Association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members met . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este , only region@@ ally is coming . &quot;
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ president of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; fundamental &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit in such steep areas .
&quot; the gr@@ ass@@ land care for a lot of work , a lot of things must be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography to fight , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the promotion of leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers need to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ est@@ ation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and have thought about how they continue to operate , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of their subsi@@ dy
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
&quot; the accounting area is 40 hectares , which may not be affor@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs were promoted by the total cost of 71 500 euros , a quarter borne by the community of fishermen . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and rural women .
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Co@@ ordin@@ ance Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state promotion of Wei@@ de@@ ye@@ urs .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the pre @-@ requ@@ isite is the presence of a flow rate marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the fence must not be operated tu@@ g ( slope gra@@ dient over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ ll project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the accounting area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the First Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals made by the President on the dras@@ tical limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not accept the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have voted him if he had done it .
&quot; but he attacked their significance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to address a complete story here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contem@@ por@@ aneous response to the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , and your afflic@@ ted masses , who are longing for free to breathe , / the burning waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; losing tr@@ ash &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the links between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical figur@@ ative portra@@ yal .
&quot; Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this long ago . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty is not inv@@ ading anyone , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that the American flame goes to the murdered world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward . &quot;
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see it as it was seen from the exhausted , el@@ ting but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to recognise . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not illumin@@ ate the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power ign@@ ited . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when only two Schot@@ ten were part of the UK team
&quot; the Performance Director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is elected by the team to team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought naturally were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will participate at 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season that was supposed to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; immen@@ sely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me , it makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t bu@@ zz yourself for a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the people of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers hit him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he ple@@ aded with criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and mu@@ te we are led as sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , expressing their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is ast@@ o@@ unding popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary shar@@ pen@@ ing head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very ade@@ pt in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and play his ha@@ iry head for chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is considered official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail talked to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound . &quot;
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his mail and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the broadcast &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people occupy the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor of the governor described as a &quot; &quot; concentrated anti @-@ spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and kill prot@@ esters .
but that is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users , who were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was in Virginia last week .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the last A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so heavy .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of letters fell upon its leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous id@@ y@@ ll .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the ren@@ aissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he settled this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the home player based in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , as it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to his home base . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; I am glad , how far it has gone . &quot;
&quot; the trio in the field is the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam , and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce &apos;s former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce is one of the six bul@@ lets on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ ham , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ros@@ s Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
researchers at the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 cases of lung cancer are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
hous@@ ings turn out to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ ingen street are in full swing and are reasonably close to time , &quot; &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house@@ wives , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground there is a lot of berge , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which constantly im@@ pe@@ des the construction works , represents a major problem for the construction crew of the company Stum@@ pp . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off gates is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses were authorized for transit .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company Stum@@ pp have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ular@@ ity in the un@@ quiet in@@ don@@ esian Province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the carbon@@ ated tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay - it has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work may be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1.0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea embra@@ ced the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is deser@@ ted . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city of 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo guar@@ dians , and made of corrugated panels , which were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light skir@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ectious and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 150,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has decreased in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has over wood resources worth USD 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military con@@ serves a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military and units of almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua &apos;s demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten the golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high land in the 1970 @-@ s have been committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are losing everything &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as illegal execution and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia Res@@ ear@@ chers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; screws have increased , because Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim business migrants come from the popul@@ ating islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell ro@@ asted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado serving a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up with them here .
&quot; migrants have started selling ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - her market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua there has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts have broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was only two months after Jok@@ o &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and singing Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their spot@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ t@@ resses , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ uli@@ o , was so hard hit that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they carried the cerem@@ onial hunting branches and led the orph@@ an@@ age - in the circle constantly and a bird singing , im@@ it@@ ating by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe . &quot;
some prot@@ esters started hau@@ ling stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of K@@ ego K@@ oto &apos;s quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and challenged the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ f was hit three times , as his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like this case immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Minister of Security , Wir@@ anto announced that he establishes an extra@@ judicial mechanism for settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ ies .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a withdrawal when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the United Nations accused the United Nations for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claiming more than 1,000 cas@@ u@@ alties in East Tim@@ or bloody independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been submitted in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fierce fi@@ d@@ acity .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us re@@ peti@@ tions the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the found@@ ries have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on village inhabitants in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a b@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones to officers , who re@@ acted on it by fir@@ ing warning shots . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself in my house two days . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police Brig@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ bl@@ eman for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by inf@@ ecting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy immigrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of media coverage remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled Eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa @-@ Den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited on May 4 , they broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; according to a source , which also took part in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , aside from living under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ o as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot @-@ victims led to a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fires capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is probably called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ am of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant telling his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 a.m. ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 resulted in the greatest part of damage from facing , outer covering to decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and fair@@ ing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des where about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has enjoyed his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two swe@@ ep@@ stak@@ es was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the often very long , but also very valuable Five set classics remain the traditional rat@@ chet . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was only scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many demands , the proposal had already come to remove the finale at a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the following year .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to perform fewer official media events prior to the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers bring For@@ bidden objects into the airplane , finding a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers found that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items passed through the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally crashed knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed , they would have discovered that they were mistakenly gone with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey for more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers tended to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; among those sur@@ vey@@ ed claiming that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were m@@ illenni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent that were members of Generation X . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said it inter@@ viewed travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently sm@@ ug@@ gled goods had brought through the airport safety , and how many had inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that the people , the most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who were the most frequent . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of objects conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA are prohibited .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has previously subjected to the fact that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn her non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k first revealed another , less brilliant figure in announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly assessment : the cancell@@ ations at the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just started . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now adm@@ its : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that this is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; presently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are present , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; its argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 it will - all models will be put together - 500,000 in 2020 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who orders a Model 3 today may be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production lines without major inter@@ ruptions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there is greater delays , then the un@@ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from passing away in pairs . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ kh withdraw@@ s due to the withdrawal of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presents the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities as far as previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a time limit , which ran for states on October 1 , in order to comply with the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ less o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ dence announced that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp , At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ de has repeatedly passed to block or delay regulation to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels are resist@@ ing . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ iting regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA authorities exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ dence suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards was simply expressing the willingness of EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we take the Law and the Authority that gives it to us .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA opinion that P@@ ru@@ ster will eventually use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; on sound policy and the best available information are based . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not set up in the Senate yet .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York opened in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ iting &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is trou@@ bling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental poll@@ u@@ ters and their particular interests . &quot;
tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery are@@ al in tum@@ ors will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 at 4.@@ 30 a.@@ m . &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and suppor@@ ter Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern for their concern .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documentary : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; according to the documents of the document , on the Tum@@ our mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the patron was right and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the wonderful sett@@ ler nucle@@ us of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 reinforce this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval period .
&quot; a gent@@ leman who built a church , furnished and occupied with a pastor , continued to remain owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this own church . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two pieces have been torn between Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were cast and the bell bars were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
the remains of the church were over@@ thrown in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ my Hil@@ arius C@@ emetery was also the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm split the bell tower and half crashed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
only the tower crane still existing today remained as witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant as successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn .
&quot; as organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ ene on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; for the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers present the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius installation , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and hear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the friends and suppor@@ ter Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martini . &quot;
association aims to allow wind turbines to be approved
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim hon@@ ors itself &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee a legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the country council . &quot;
the Bo@@ is@@ heim association hon@@ ors itself &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion from wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a mould failure . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the issue of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also decl@@ ining , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council has decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; an approval from the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally impossible . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been entered into the circle of Vier@@ sen past week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to talk about the argument of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ halle presented green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in the process .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion accompanying her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and dealer plan home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ z@@ aer and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping tour in the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to raise the customers for their own city outside the usual supermarket product . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
local firms should also present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite for &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action does not only focus on residents of the city and the region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the commercial association and the city are going into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reno@@ unc@@ ement of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center shopping from the sight .
&quot; at the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ cast@@ ed , had told King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities will take part in the national &quot; Heimat shopping &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and promote its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct environment .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them hard . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade on Wednesday ( local time ) , a vulner@@ ability was in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later also dead .
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as a result of an accident , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building . &quot;
Tru@@ mp continued calls for ph@@ ased feeds of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
a tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp asked in a phone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly state that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president den@@ ounced him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to him , he said to him : &quot; &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an ex@@ ited exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; de@@ p . &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford mass@@ acres : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way . &quot;
the mo@@ b leader - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield under review .
inside the in@@ mates floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man bre@@ wed . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am torn the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience sounded very real si@@ gh @-@ gro@@ wers . &quot;
since 2005 citizens come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
&quot; it serves as a dramatic call to action as a dramatic call to action , and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to finish , we want to cure , we want reconciliation , but first we have to obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
&quot; a bai@@ li@@ ff puts a blan@@ ket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding Gra@@ f@@ ences were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on a free base for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch campaigns throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ bed according to the F@@ BI the black farmers Roger Mal@@ com one white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby that she wore did not come from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; concludes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in murder , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks phrase it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is descrip@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is based on a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen sheep and the rest of black - pressed into a room and listened as gre@@ ene a well rehear@@ sed overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , rehear@@ sed by Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- er , disappear from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona ref@@ utes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s most lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still smiling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people have said &apos; n --- he &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ t@@ ess one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you just need to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and precisely here the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship sub@@ stitutes dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene once again begins .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he tells it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely nobody laugh@@ s .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice stops at every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced the humidity of Geor@@ gi@@ as almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels like gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ mu@@ red as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ g rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w surrounded Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience is sitting together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at one table , a white pair of Atlanta stimul@@ ates the delivery with a black pair that they have just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feeling the performance left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone tells Broo@@ ks &apos; farm at his table , he e@@ ats and re@@ members the citizen &apos;s rights . &quot;
he said he began planning the performance next year .
&quot; the position is in some way inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth &quot;
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sits on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ floor backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including the Wall B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rh@@ en@@ ish daughters are pos@@ ing as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which pul@@ ls itself through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three en@@ chan@@ ters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;

&quot; there is great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a whi@@ stling concert on himself , five years later , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; bush @-@ calls &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;

&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with pe@@ at , but also an understanding of what has grown . &quot;
I draw a positive summary .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at the school in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ headed volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is the wrong for me , and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can make it from the old home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also part of the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon service . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works .
different than in building engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people head , who each have a different story behind each other . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you always have to pay attention to it . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
&quot; quantity : for this , I am not the type . &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so life is . &quot;
Pear@@ son cut more than 3.000 jobs and cut the dividend to revi@@ ve business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut off their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome pressure with which the company is faced . &quot;
&quot; the job assignment , the Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 jobs . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May , in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remains unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul &apos;s Afghan capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and condemned NATO &apos;s declaration .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violent act that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Bag@@ ram Air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide @-@ car bomb killed at least 30 people in a main Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban away from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp weighs down , increasing the number of U.S. troops , the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks , the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , in which the states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remember that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ kh in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ kh had announced the intention of EPA to determine the Oz@@ on@@ determin@@ ations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions have to be measured in a part of the country , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp should stimulate economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that breathing air that contains o@@ zone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
common room wants common room
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in case of two counter@@ vote , the community at Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln ap@@ points the establishment of a community space in the future Senior Citiz@@ ens facility . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is still owned by the church community , there is no planning permission for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a community space . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are ho@@ vering in front of such a common room not as a meeting place for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly in the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn , by means of funding possibilities . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 per cent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution is to show the investor that in this respect it is not intended to throw a bill@@ ets between the legs , the finding that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ - - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as a pul@@ s@@ roof - which reduces the height of the tr@@ uss and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings , with which one can &apos;t move so well , but you don &apos;t have to sit in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m doing hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a communal involvement .
&quot; it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy of any wealthy , or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but get a real , in doubt market@@ able counter@@ part , is the counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request , to ple@@ ad the proposed resolution , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; two contrasts with the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; if we touch the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
colli@@ sion with car : cyclists will be thrown on the road
&quot; while crossing the street , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police claimed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer route from Hil@@ den heading towards Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
a passenger car driver running in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove on the road , he obviously did not respect the traffic . &quot;
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ woman .
the man was thrown onto the road .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ cher .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to let the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel @-@ care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the staff@@ ing care at German Football Record Champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to disp@@ ense with the BV@@ B also to David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the mouth @-@ ch@@ ick@@ ens Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has made responsible the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his crew . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into its spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Soccer League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
in the Harz Mountains from Stern to Stern
&quot; in the Harz region , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Planet@@ en@@ weg in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the visitor &apos;s need of information , called it . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; accessible installations at five to six places &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber cheese . &quot;
the information on the boards should be complemented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the &quot; &quot; Star Path train &quot; &quot; will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star light more light than another , although it was far more distant . &quot;
&quot; in what con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet &apos;s path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; beginning in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet &apos;s path with its stel@@ ae up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( district Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to derived to the d@@ warf @-@ plan - are positioned exactly in the distance and a measure of one to two billion .
&quot; the Earth thus shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeter diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away measuring 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the station with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would still last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a colli@@ sion course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate premises in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ har@@ assed World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing organization Super Feder@@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ one World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both Fi@@ ghters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defend his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as observed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 pound de@@ br@@ is this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 bone @-@ outs ) which also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on 23rd September . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later pressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may be participating in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three combat champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show strength , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after bur@@ sting
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was losing control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 hrs . &quot;
&quot; the car tow@@ ed right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned himself and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the wounded by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by at the accident point . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ mmer works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann will hope after the 2 : 2 at the beginning of the season against Braunschweig showing the optimization of defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , as wasn &apos;t the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ angles should be further optimized .
and a door@@ way after an off@@ ence the for@@ tun@@ ers don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in the preparation with the tri@@ mmer , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ed chain . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause because we have just in the tri@@ cky on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , but that we harmon@@ ize even better and we don &apos;t afford so many playing mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a mis@@ match of a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a normal season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a bad weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e may even have something fresh as they would not have a hard and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know about 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come among the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant .
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have undergone a new approach to medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Food Safety Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish migration authorities ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) critici@@ zed for mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees that were at least age @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; to date Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &quot; was possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty consistent , &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily imply that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det studied the results published in 5@@ 81 , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the medical age assessment method , including x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I recep@@ tions of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very well in time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the department of road construction and traffic in the District Court of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works started at the same time on all three patient bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is scheduled for October , and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges connect over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sand@@ stone .
&quot; both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a border forti@@ fication , which is also used as a way of operation . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2.@@ 20 meters wide should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will be lost .
&quot; the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented brid@@ les .
particular finger tip @-@ feeling has required laying pipes through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ writing about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be eaten initially . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collective pastures towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled sing@@ ular traffic by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge notes amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties are pulling in a rush , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented by the Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag on that day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle belongs to the poster &quot; &quot; Big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the African voters , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city picnic was under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; planned at the fountain , but now takes place in the parking lot beneath the R@@ ond@@ ola - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , which shows presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he has taken care of such an event and received the surcharge . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch there are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is also happening : at 8 p.m. on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ platz , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chairman Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the audi@@ torium about 200 listeners , who wait for the top candidate for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; some more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is said shortly after 9@@ pm . &quot;
the police cannot put forward - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; another hearing with the wolf tro@@ mb@@ onist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire to not only transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the N@@ ils W@@ ogram , jazz and free games to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try out all , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart frank@@ ly openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably best @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the one to their &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ended up bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures her &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I have seriously fallen in love with whom I got . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten stated that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so I never confused or hin@@ der me .
I &apos;ve never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them suffered , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time , when they preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me as und@@ am@@ aged , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will say to you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp announced a major announcement at West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice won &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working on it to make our country great again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without guidance from top to bottom and is not able to find a positive , incoming message , &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC leader R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the worldwide leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be absorbed again into the sport . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Director D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ap@@ h said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said it &apos;s sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been cut away by cont@@ ests of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the Re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; he said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , starting on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he said to Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
ceremony for the deport@@ ation of soldiers in Mali
&quot; at a funeral ceremony in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ischer F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , some 1,000 people of the two soldiers have thought about a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; to the even un@@ clari@@ fied fall @-@ back cause , Defense Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; but she described the two opposite pilots , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest offering that they have furnished in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday in the West African Mali on Wednesday .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the Church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral ceremony took place in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general insp@@ ector of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the members stood by arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
before the church F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Minister of Defense of the Ley@@ en described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sh@@ attered . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann took up the flying operation of the helicopter tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regim@@ ents .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , the minister of the Ley@@ en did not show : the deployment was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of high importance for a country , of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agrees with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a meal that he wasn &apos;t happy with his title .
&quot; after the hei@@ r of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also rel@@ inqu@@ ished the title of &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flo@@ ated , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign of the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik stated about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ alistic intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants spe@@ edy re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before potential majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the Parliament expressed itself on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its parliament in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Gre@@ ens of Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record it . &quot;
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony &apos;s Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
he said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , thinks it is imperative that the country @-@ day passes as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday for further action on Tuesday . &quot;
the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility of the country parliament to withdraw confidence and elect a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; these opportunities must be insp@@ ected legally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally certified . &quot;
&quot; th@@ aw@@ ler called &quot; &quot; West &apos;s step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself emphasized : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their state mandate .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has received her state mandate , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; divided the head of the Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group leader Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead a debate in the faction .
&quot; even in the background , there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
&quot; SPD candidate , Martin Schulz , condem@@ ns the transfer of the Dutch Gre@@ ens Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; the president of the Socialists and Democrats wrote on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the Austr@@ itt T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian , in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration , put her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gu@@ ing game and attempts to make political capital out of it .
Dutch &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , rejected T@@ westen with personal career gifts to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a deci@@ de@@ dly majority of one voice in the country tag . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the st@@ amping pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states are presenting the latest information about the respective egg @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to all that we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
does Al@@ di now assume the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tened minister is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately stopped and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade is just as important as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health @-@ harmless .
&quot; if the level of the resi@@ due amount of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not able to transport . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the enterprises are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current knowledge of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any direct guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service providers . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the seri@@ ousness . &quot;
is it missing only on the personnel or also on the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
&quot; there were just the official controls , which have un@@ covered the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes are available are of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made it clear several times , that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumer consumers have the right to get only safe and transpor@@ table foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the tried @-@ and @-@ tested means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are caught in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide &apos;s Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it has to be worked consistently on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect all competent authorities that the facts are resolved promptly and without gaps .
how the finance rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , aimed at preventing un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted issues of European football clubs , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will be added to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s reloc@@ ation to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make the money loose to sign up N@@ ey@@ mar and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the rich Herr@@ scher@@ family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must deal with legitimate sources of income that enable them to make the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Pl@@ ini , after his election as the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin , when banks or owners withdraw their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P de@@ pot period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter him from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; sorry , FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the rep@@ ay@@ ments for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the club members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs , which could try to review their financial supervision by bl@@ aming their revenue through companies associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be deemed to be legitimate revenues . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsorship was brought up by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar will be ambassador to World Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors and that such a maneu@@ ver could be easy to figure out for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; so far , the sanctions against PS@@ G will mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , announc@@ ing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ ales . &quot;
the association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the contract .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y served on board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a potential end : the airline is writing the order . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be examined every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;

Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer , it is a prestigious job . &quot;
&quot; as many applicants have given the new tender , Swiss will not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Swiss have been distributing chocolate panels on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before comm@@ itting a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied the chocolate @-@ tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ ies , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ old turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the G@@ ags - middle aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ it back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emoti@@ onally gro@@ unded and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the phi@@ list@@ ine principle , including a reef on the stal@@ ker @-@ films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ cks the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; on one point , a character hits an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old st@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could make this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I accepted as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard so@@ iled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be du@@ b@@ bed in English . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on television as Americans may do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ ding the voice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single one . &quot;
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; , &quot; which was re@@ arranged to a lesser extent , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , dev@@ our@@ ing a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were scann@@ ed in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accused were arrested between 25 years and 77 years of age and had already issued an arrest warrant against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials also ensured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
&quot; in the campaign , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
altogether over 300 police officers were in use .
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organized drug crime , serious violence , addic@@ ted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor has been investigating the organised drug trade in the southern German area . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als with close reference to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreigners registry
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners registry in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to a media report on large gaps in the foreigners &apos; register . &quot;
&quot; defic@@ iencies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious short@@ com@@ ings in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; , &quot; warned thereby in an analysis that is available to the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , ten million people have been registered with foreign nation@@ als , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 had been found &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entries can slow down reverse processes considerably , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics about paid people , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to leave at all . &quot;
&quot; however , such false assignments led to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with a paid issue , &quot; &quot; said it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year old children if they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF maintains such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper cli@@ cked to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot;
Italy has given away for the admission and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these commitments enough .
&quot; other EU states , too , would send back refugees to the Dublin convention . &quot;
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in total 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach , the blood donation service has already been available to other people . &quot;
at least of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .
&quot; all of them are Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community acknow@@ le@@ dges multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it and we are willing to respect the don@@ ors that provide their blood for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; emphas@@ ised Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district supervis@@ or of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ en@@ bacher , for the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ en@@ bacher was covered by the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K District Manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple @-@ giving and have been awarded for 50 daily blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many tickets booked Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spend ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their life juice . &quot;
bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they settled the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , because the weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income is likely to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot;
but they indicated that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to re@@ ap the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the upcoming February , although it is said that now it is expected that it will provide $ 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; in minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to poll@@ ute consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for cooling down inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; step @-@ by @-@ step &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would take place . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro . &quot;
&quot; the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on interest rate increase , and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not &quot; &quot; prevent in@@ comes from in@@ comes , &quot; &quot; but she added that the wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast can be &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expendi@@ tures . &quot;
the decision comes one year after the decrease in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the reason .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and it will be tigh@@ tened again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing dealers are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is alleged to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ positioning pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) prev@@ ent@@ ative prior to sexual intercourse , which can l@@ essen the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health care for a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to be made available to people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a series of HIV preparations used prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified that consent to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is targeted and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; said Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if directed specifically to patients and endangered , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we cordi@@ ally welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , President of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect individuals who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the cess@@ ation of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne D@@ oom and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over the other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on one another , without having to bend down . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that it had the correct height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
the kitchen feels like a window in another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the seating and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push the door up , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials , which give space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ality from something standard to something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might choose not to leave this . &quot;
brothers struggling for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of Vic@@ tori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate , worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and their business . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a fierce debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the Brothers have acquired 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the family West@@ co Jeans founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - of Paul described as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in property has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a direct debit .
&quot; the essays proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affir@@ m@@ ative . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul affir@@ ms , has ruled out him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage several pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to join the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage is that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , dairy and delic@@ at@@ essen business from the late 1950s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood stock , in which Col@@ in opened the first shop of jeans . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co when he was in the last years of High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group . Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; only Col@@ in replied via SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would end up in our current conflict , &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new chief of staff plans to limit media abst@@ in@@ ence from the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new chief of staff of the White House , met with senior officers on his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information entered into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media di@@ ets .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relation to television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ alism is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when he was upset because of unfair competition , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former campaign officials is to ensure that his personal consumption of media includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter custom was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
&quot; perhaps these campaign officials know something we others do not know , that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets without their intervention would have included even more combus@@ ti@@ bles . &quot;
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has consistently prevented it that Tru@@ mp has spark@@ ed controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that might promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - completely occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons to indu@@ ce doubt . &quot;
this was an example written by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they originate from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ new@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for Schi@@ kan@@ en , or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has vo@@ iced incorrect alleg@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked her . &quot;
Williams read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former chief of staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe disp@@ ose of dangerous criminals on the flight this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after s@@ words are not known naturally , references from the population are hoped and prayed . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; advent calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many fle@@ xes would hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ o@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online requests could have been taken up so far , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aires &apos; Series
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travelers on war@@ lords , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch from the community in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ged from the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defensive systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry citizens have ur@@ ging the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are back now . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my share if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be mentioned said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of those travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine , when we put our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; with the closing of the Birken@@ hof hotel through the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also revenues through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees that came to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented accommodation from asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time at that time .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house .
he should be right .
&quot; Birgit Sch@@ erer &apos;s Managing Director , Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , blan@@ kets partly removed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with spacious showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set itself wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , he said . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he is calcul@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor installations are also brought to foreground , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be open to the restaurant , which is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : U.S. Special Agent sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia @-@ affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have deployed a report to a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the panel has recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the radio station CN@@ N reported that there are already first dischar@@ ges of the Gre@@ g in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time interven@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are accused of acting as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ can in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also picked up more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special promot@@ er Tru@@ mp has personally moved to the centre and dis@@ covers whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called &quot; Ank@@ le Cham@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for consultation under oath .
&quot; according to the station CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in the report , people who participated in the meeting were called upon to testify . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were there during the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television , that the substitu@@ tion show that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he should act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new ground for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President , on Thursday night , used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a possibility to &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but these work also usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House supports all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the President .
&quot; there is no reason to believe that something has changed , it was stated in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this r@@ ash , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have been loud , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up the investigations against the former national security advisor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
this delet@@ es spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be released .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired upon pres@@ crip@@ tions of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be released so easily . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a giant ic@@ eberg has loos@@ ened itself from the barely seven @-@ fold magnitude of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ vio . &quot;
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , which is heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , is unclear according to research data . &quot;
&quot; however , for about 30 years , however , there has been a series of unusual bur@@ sts of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken colli@@ sion has so far been part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ock@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ock@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this cow@@ ard , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort occurred several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ vio is torn there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ock@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart , if a piece break down at a key point . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it comes after melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice cream makes it possible that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in small measure , the British research project writes for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l is the fourth @-@ largest pillar of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ock@@ s will grow back or go back over the long term , and possibly merged , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers are not trac@@ ing the demoli@@ tion of this giant ic@@ eberg on climate change , many king@@ fish@@ ers of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey research program , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; over the last 50 years , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has heated by around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U intends building tariff for staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U asks to leave the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the day of the Cre@@ tac@@ tic Day has made 41 new places in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in circles are obviously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year .
&quot; however , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann County . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
&quot; in Krei@@ sau , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to not only cover the short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented candidate scar@@ city . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an education offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is of a regular &quot; competition by the public employer . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees who reti@@ re from the service is due to illness or age due to age . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common motion with his party . &quot;
he had long since been anxious for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel charges and aston@@ ished the other parties .
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which permit a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county administration with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envis@@ ages the fare for the public service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is available only if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new constitutional law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO migrants
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat from the German rescue organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express himself in detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian public prosec@@ utor , Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only evaluate all alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew will ship din@@ gh@@ y migrants , which are delivered directly by men &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart for the ships to be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles in front of Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not have &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Prize winner organisation is Doctor without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants , who arrived in Italy after the emergency relief measures , declined strongly in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have taken fruits . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in Nord@@ pf@@ al@@ z for four days of tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely long asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ bul@@ ations . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; again v@@ antage point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , there were again many al@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ lets brought a welcome break . &quot;

&quot; after 173 km and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of tur@@ f - Bundes@@ liga equipment for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium quickly in case of wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included . &quot;
this has also recognised the first federal li@@ ga@@ ars who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg took place , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that there are still many clubs rising on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London where gamers from different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified themselves . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now providing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA are being challenged at competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , Li@@ gen has long since established itself , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly used to get used . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ank@@ y also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that you also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gamers should not only train on the console , but also train their body and respect the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itt@@ y player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing . &quot;
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Enter@@ taining Software ( BI@@ U ) suggests that E @-@ sport requires rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
sales are expected to lie at 130 million in three years .
&quot; in addition to the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international are many countries already on the agenda .
&quot; major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports event provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school E @-@ sport has been introduced as a pe@@ dago@@ gue , says F@@ rob@@ ank@@ . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are meanwhile required to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; just to fall into nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
it is not possible to hold onto that only in football everything remains as it was always .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June due to negli@@ gent kill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy , who took her life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , folded hands and eyes directed , when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which she completely de@@ pl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy that said that there is &quot; no day , in which I do not enter the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Gary &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person , with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to invite others to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon dioxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed , that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spr@@ ing@@ y from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to switch the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the event by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was a member of Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the New Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain for the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a big season for the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not har@@ ming .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm , and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the tied ban@@ dage to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the stand could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also indicate Kim@@ i so .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen in the C @-@ El@@ f existing C @-@ El@@ f from youth players , Deb@@ ut@@ ants and just out of holiday , but he . &quot;
it is best to distribute sugar@@ s to those you want to keep in your spirits .
those who were chosen to compete for the hei@@ r of L@@ ahm can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ahm scored over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , that is now its position , the white binding on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general , Kim@@ me worked as the one who can best take the ru@@ dder in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ play@@ able troops . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
Vi@@ dal thus to re@@ play his lack of fitness ( folding hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches started to tie at Teufel come out to the achievements of the Asia @-@ journey ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver so that in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ jer@@ sey not to be negative .
this all worked very well .
&quot; Sü@@ ver ran along Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli Storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ ver also tried a few times in the build @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we expected it . &quot;
but he also showed decent performance at the debut .
&quot; reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also brought up . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but definitely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ my said goodbye to a couple of cris@@ p statements in his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ ver : &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one any more . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still business secretary of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows itself after more than a year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and enterprises from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has altogether blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn @-@ turn looks nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the junction of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; still this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is expected to be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Tra@@ cing of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal road network plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann &apos;s Minister of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; of course , nat@@ us sees a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) aims at Trier as von Wis@@ sing , with the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that has been sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber commen@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; intended is a premium of 1000 Euro for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the master &apos;s training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road construction , quickly facts are to be created , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan glo@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility have only been occupied at 29 locations . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry asks for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; according to this , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bald@@ auf is referring to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the present broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the rating of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and abor@@ tions .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ econom@@ ist E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and is still sitting at the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months , it was clearing the field for dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair told the company that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving limits , &quot; thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to for@@ bid or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
&quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the car manufacturer to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases caused by diesel vehicles also increase , which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of having to indul@@ ge in the mighty car companies and to ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called dep@@ ol@@ ding equipment that could regulate emissions in order to meet the regulations when a car was tested , but re@@ trac@@ ted with normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were charged ; others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions rules in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is dispro@@ portion@@ ately committed to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; thus also the Is@@ ar visitors enter , on tomorrow Saturday a raft goes through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , on the way to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big float between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and that is not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists . &quot;
but the building reference is intended to enligh@@ ten .
&quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ tee . &quot;
it shows a gar@@ bage .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be shar@@ pen@@ ed as a protective game of wildlife . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft crossed the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los , rab@@ bits and laughter for suffering &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon @-@ dra@@ fts@@ men , the rab@@ bits of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still draws and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as an artist for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris he succeeded in the breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist of cities was inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he still sits still at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours every day . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches still find its dro@@ pping figures much more widespread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
&quot; the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los of any most popular animal in his drawings - , which has a thous@@ and@@ th as an opponent . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that will come onto the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he rather sits on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ally . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threat@@ ens climate change from Provence
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases transmitting insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , are causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacteria that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ic@@ adas , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing down evap@@ oration from soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resili@@ ent to d@@ rought . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings range . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is their editor and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smile face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only initiated two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists rarely be tried in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ separ@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very foo@@ lish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we mi@@ stru@@ ct everyone . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but to the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only one cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes to the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first there was the publication of an interview with Damascus , Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed v@@ ein members bought every copy of the issue , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he served as an experienced re@@ porter for North Africa in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drugs problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez has won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot;
he gave up will@@ ingly that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task you become a journalist , either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love to the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret run@@ ways , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no cell phones allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the Gover@@ nor referred to as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spread to three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of brother &apos;s brother Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an exposure to the government spending , concentrating on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , carried out a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political layers almost the whole century . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
only a few months earlier the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador All@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
journalists have become more lou@@ der throughout the country by writing in organised protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked her to re @-@ divide it from the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organized crime , government officials involved and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are in addition to their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug traff@@ icking sc@@ ares him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting at the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer than at once all of their phones were to be sum@@ mon@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tap@@ e@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the town of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead . &quot;
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the ker@@ bst@@ one edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l near - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch , to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visi@@ bly visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its mark . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; If on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain crafts@@ man were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even find that its sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; the whis@@ per@@ ing din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ si@@ r that lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock out of the platform , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature was to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shield technique known as counter@@ weight , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to ming@@ le better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say what is suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature of the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now featured in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ shade , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter shade is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals living today . &quot;
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs of enough pressure was hun@@ ted by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ shade - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alled that these no@@ dos@@ ages were exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been pre@@ dat@@ ors of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it did as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ r is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just play a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period was a time , as huge di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Re@@ x , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal of Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the thou@@ ghtful arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es was weak@@ ened by Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house cr@@ ates still cover hol@@ low@@ ly arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in the Lotto . &quot;
&quot; the more I get it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; c@@ logged remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ ge .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long St@@ ones - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first details of the police were around 5 p.m. between the connecting points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ tw@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no information about the exact number of publishers . &quot;
&quot; it was a slight to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .
the A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a round trip of approximately ten kilometres was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ re@@ porter reported , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous guns . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ated the characteristics of the car owners , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it had come to a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident point .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing sits in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buffer .
the conductor comes and awak@@ ens an uns@@ an@@ ft or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
passport control .
but the times of inter@@ ruptions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the public ticket control .
&quot; one simply confirms by mobile phone , that it is taken to occupy the seat and thus de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , it is expected to be available on many other long haul routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the card de@@ valuation without conductor .
&quot; in order to be able to use them , some requirements must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket below &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and occupied the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the driver &apos;s ticket control comes to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attend@@ ant , check out in the DB Navigator just by myself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to person@@ alize their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Cor@@ respon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train , knows that besides delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; however , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents necessary for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the identity card , or any other document you have to submit . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train esc@@ ort and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the depart@@ ement or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the artist at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how did an activ@@ ist come to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core .
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , letting them rent and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police had just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ched on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bare body that was stretched out on the road and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police and people scre@@ amed , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman faced a group of demonstr@@ ators with a dog bark@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman took his ri@@ fle and scre@@ amed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence , which consists of the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what is happening today is a culmin@@ ation of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution know and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a lat@@ ent racism , she is no different from the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
&quot; I feel I would have a bad service , to keep them away from them . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter settled with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s figure .
&quot; my activ@@ ism was totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
a question came to mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of ?
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other local people the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; followed in the years to Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious candidate of the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s life as she loves and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; chosen by Fer@@ rel@@ l on account of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sha@@ ved this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the message cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; however , she cl@@ ings herself to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers are discussing bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit Gallery moves people , even though it is not built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area , since the first presentation of 2009 , divi@@ des the population into supporters and opponents . &quot;
the topic hardly leaves the topic .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; needs no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ occupy ) or simply simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the other shops profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be the end . &quot;
the Gallery Mak@@ ers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the peasant market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ma@@ ids are always very happy . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery res@@ ett@@ les , comes to the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this should not be very low with the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rental companies are often not portable to a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer there and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant Mark@@ thalle take place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes .
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery previously to distribute all stores from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; this simply won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - how I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer a place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching lik@@ eness : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly resem@@ ble - hung on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ mark@@ ers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being publicly classified as secret diplomatic noti@@ fications of the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming Stres@@ a lance ( A suitable resem@@ b@@ lance ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and landmark dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp , though some intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 counts including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a Kör@@ ni@@ ges , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette but@@ ts and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA @-@ portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal bridges that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert chel@@ ated judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tru@@ mp is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , T@@ we@@ et@@ able ways to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with its over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name has been provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence , a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed schol@@ ar of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , late Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic @-@ no@@ vels mentioned above . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how it appears in the hands of the discipl@@ in@@ arian bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; when they create your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the mas@@ ks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea , like the movement , which also stuck behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of University of Nor@@ th@@ western and one of Oxford University Emplo@@ ye@@ es for K@@ illing
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warrant for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the County Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a Community warning system issued by the police authorities of Chicago states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of the action , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , Vice President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ it had now been certified and excluded from entering the Campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair which is examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email explaining that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police in the UK to help US investig@@ ators in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip which said that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 , too . &quot;
security cameras confirmed that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the Management Team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will finish the W@@ A@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ champion Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Russian ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ A@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ A@@ DA timetable for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the Organization .
&quot; according to mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause anxiety to Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ A@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the W@@ A@@ DA by Canadian law Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ all words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov reported problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody seems to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; during the course of the D@@ oping sc@@ andal , Rus@@ ada was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in Moscow in July , W@@ A@@ DA CEO , Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , stated that Rus@@ ada went &quot; in the right direction , &quot; in order to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di sold no more eggs

&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed from any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which were demonstr@@ ably tested negative on pro@@ legs @-@ containing anti @-@ lice . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency in its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called people out of the outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers permit to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ veys and Poll@@ s from specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ boot , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ ale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth in 2020 , according to the Finance website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and recognise bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ ko@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and processes and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submitting a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously concealed by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ inees more quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree perspective in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ scent offer your software as a service and loads the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to get the consent of venture capital investors that have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their work@@ places than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that hear their voices , and that the work they do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ ding when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data about employee involvement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not coming quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow disappointment and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 ideas , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , thus saving . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes on at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ player enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it actually leng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ in postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood went through practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August , 18 exercises should be held . 20 before the start of formal toys for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the Rule Change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multi @-@ employed route of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been dispos@@ ed with foot@@ b@@ older , which will be a protective net behind a gate area , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then sit there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties and show their results under the original report , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false news and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews , which may display results of the invoice verification from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , although French voters were floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany will support a plan where social media networks are to be punished . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts check is started . &quot;
&quot; aside from the knowledge which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to feature &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ ies and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the irri@@ gation river valley in K@@ ent and is now turned to inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; embra@@ ces the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he un@@ expect@@ edly found emoti@@ onally . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell as smoke , for at that time there was lit a fire for the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this is all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the site and the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke with landscape fle@@ ets , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des hit a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats told &quot; Oh , put it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who had what had said : &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all its way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patent , which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who staged its own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s &quot; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; men seemed to be quite a fence , always making debt and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy elderly women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ am experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a San@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ op@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the filling of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Art@@ z want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ en@@ dorfer chapel yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than just &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount allows the city of Bad Honnef to try its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts over pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps in Ankara . &quot;
so this week too .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five vic@@ tors and ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number . &quot;
the government pre@@ fers the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the army , the air strike forces and the Navy were dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erd@@ og@@ an has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erd@@ og@@ an sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 48@@ 6 people , who were to have participated directly in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara following this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the attempt to overthrow the army as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an actually have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest itself in the lifting of the ban on soldiers for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the case in the army and the security forces goes on . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an made another 73@@ 95 state @-@ ear@@ ners mo@@ ist by decree , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly the masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least under the appeal to the reforms of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an exagger@@ ates the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a notably un@@ named officer sought asylum from persecution abroad for asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not let Nato become cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the deployment of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he proposes to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by issuing the way to the citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English speaking the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry aims to renov@@ ate track for Renn@@ stei@@ b@@ ord
&quot; over the past few months , over the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been cont@@ ested - now it is to go quite quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the route is to be built on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will begin on the track according to the Ministry of Transport this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this especially for tourism , &quot; said Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of the maintenance of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the land grab@@ s 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently permanently adjusted , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; thus the timetable , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a term of eleven years .
&quot; in doing so , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be to be ordered regularly in December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by sufficient numbers of people to re @-@ order them again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the route is heavily b@@ older in parts . &quot;
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it could not be even crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking its Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when releasing his new report . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot;
modern sex doll@@ s have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as best as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , be fix@@ ated on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female properties , the all@@ usion to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; means it on the site . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation refer to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission than optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is perme@@ ated out of the zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are bog@@ us slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Spe@@ ech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of sound human condition
&quot; it has become a tru@@ mp @-@ wisdom of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized U.S. elec@@ torate , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tru@@ mp @-@ choosing relatives . &quot;
we are all claiming to let our filter bags burst .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , bringing families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom they strug@@ gled for decades for politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; there is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but I think that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the imposing effect of his pres@@ idency has the strength to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; speaking of &quot; Norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be abor@@ ted anymore . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the right wing is &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself covered by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ onic version of crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked out ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp dies , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the Car@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks Service Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals are twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cycli@@ cal music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many cli@@ ch@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not entirely across the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in northern London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Car@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
on the other hand I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the review with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually a neutral replacement should be , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year jail term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too indul@@ gent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ative Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger Schools , the four @-@ t@@ all@@ ers from F@@ yers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the further schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the in@@ let students go to gymn@@ asi@@ um , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes chose Sop@@ hia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eag@@ le growing up in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical called &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to brood from his ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eag@@ le came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making him a chicken was broken , and the eag@@ le spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed a chicken dance three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stands for the integration , said school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ aller to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again and again helped with pe@@ dagog@@ y courses , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time was over now , declared class teacher Sop@@ hia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she was only very reluc@@ tant to leave school , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they have been able to rely on the qu@@ at@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
&quot; for the new school year , eight first ders have already been registered . &quot;
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , condemned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal tents was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp , and to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they will improve the emission characteristics of cars in the emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann Software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced their immediate implementation in the coming months , but they do not have an exact date yet . &quot;
Daimler advised to address every affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection . &quot;
how long will the changes take place ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers act on the subject environment so far not . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers who do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving pro@@ hibitions thre@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; in rural areas , there have been no losses for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize , under President Tru@@ mp , promises to become political . &quot;
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and will join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the prize winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to refra@@ in from participating in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and this bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp in order to make her point of view clear . &quot;
&quot; this Kennedy Center named after former President , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be reti@@ ring next year . &quot;
the place is already written out - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker City Builder has been a city builder . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press talk .
&quot; he reports about varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a revision .
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as the Lower Construction Law Authority , the applicant has to submit relevant certificates . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , several important projects have accumulated to look back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the remo@@ del@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz can be found . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the renovation of the stadium is still subject to change . &quot;
&quot; the latter will hit with approximately 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city builder of great scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gardening company can be re@@ acted flexibly to many .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble under monument protection stands , it is important to &quot; &quot; have an eye on what fits &quot; , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the wan@@ ing city builder emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city builder is responsible for a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here above my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor is staying for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who would like to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should , according to information from Has@@ lach , have a completed course of studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree with special@@ ising in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building instruction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt sub@@ mits high and civil engineering , building guidelines , gr@@ under@@ ing opportunities , management of municipal property , municipal farm with building yard and municipal gar@@ dener as well as Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : south @-@ way closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
they were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and look for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , a number of sco@@ ot@@ ers and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; says Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators or the offen@@ ders would have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the rail transport .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the equipment , as well as the delay and the costs for a moving rail traffic , even pat@@ rons of the rail customers could come to the offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; overall , to go out of a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south run@@ way could be led without any disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall , however , they had delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
&quot; but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting the US approximately 1.3 million and in the UK , 300,000 , causes ga@@ stri@@ c cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ re@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not enter the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of trig@@ gering ignition , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments were found that a type of tolerance induc@@ ing immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el , if the same system also affects people . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ doctor Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem which was not housed separately . &quot;
&quot; it suppos@@ es that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how bacteria prolifer@@ ated on the immune system , the researchers left L. Cross in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - on imm@@ atur@@ ated immune cells , isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice , and that most of us L. Cross are protected in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tracts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. Cross develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; with Manchester United signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pres@@ e@@ ason game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira fl@@ ashed at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the premi@@ er league season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks he thinks of football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ and and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; in this week , the Independent revealed three more commitments , but it insi@@ sted that the club already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given themselves great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off from Seattle in the U.S. State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously had such advertisement previously .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new bass driver for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , as the wind twi@@ sts : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked after the elections with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only there was no fire @-@ fire from the party central , but no head@@ wind out of the Bund - so was the most important wish of the campaign fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch with growing horror the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with head@@ winds in the approach .
there were ra@@ inf@@ all .
and one after another .
&quot; after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal @-@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called upon the apost@@ ate Dutch Gre@@ ens of El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive and election director of the Green Press Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD vot@@ er si@@ gh@@ ed when the new Hi@@ ob message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for CD@@ U without its own government majority after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen there . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly sharp defeat at the Saarland choice in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades mil@@ ked at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; this was the case , and everything was much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into pi@@ geons , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously dra@@ gged back in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just made new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next fall .
&quot; mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , it was pretty much wrong with what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ fl@@ yers and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in the criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey results were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely this is why , in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l tried harder to set acc@@ ents in the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the ambi@@ tions of the former mayor of Hanover , expanding its power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him go , as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all at all .
&quot; at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; her anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is intoler@@ able and democratic as Ms. T@@ westen puts her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party link in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ westen is not elected because of her person as direct candidate , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Saxon member continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the choice of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD SPD as a top candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U members fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there was more or given additional commitments to CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding allowance for local nucle@@ us III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get assistance from the country .
&quot; on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of the city development informed Urban Development on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the informative event , Sch@@ in@@ dler presented once again a review of what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 there have been in sens@@ ations of renovation .
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the former renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is also important to promote internal development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , we received the information from the District Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a restructuring area III . &quot;
&quot; the total amount tot@@ alled 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s feeling . &quot;
how does a renovation area arise ?
&quot; one will continue to examine Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is no interest in san@@ itation .
&quot; if necessary , the area boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EG on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Program &quot; Social city , &quot; in which frames would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is called per plot . &quot;
the restructuring area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the survey , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area , a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the decree shall be made possible so that in the coming year it will be possible to start renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ ech@@ sch@@ mann declared that each municipality must carry out the said preliminary examinations . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to assess and decide the circumstances of urban development , and to decide when to repair and to what extent . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , there will be questionn@@ aires which will be sent to the citizens post @-@ al@@ ally in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and land &quot; &quot; in which it deals among other things the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if the premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel advised that a filled questionn@@ aire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funds after the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes . &quot;
one could not reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Place II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to get into home and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertisers cost of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that American manufacturing rises last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s specifications , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter set in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was on display next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a fork @-@ lift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military office required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Chron@@ ic@@ le of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds Federal Off@@ ices to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impulse to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
&quot; but to demand its use only for a photo @-@ operation , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation when the presidential car was running in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential car through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - showing the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ res .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House conducted 58 practice landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was the training demand for the flight crew for the month , said an officer . &quot;
helicop@@ ters flew an additional 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers did not exceed the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to hourly rates of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to USD 24.@@ 380 per flight . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the reimbur@@ sement sets is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ person of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ icer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ icer . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear if Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ one with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
the leading runner of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga appears at the Table 3rd Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel on the third Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leading runner of the second tennis league got the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
especially in the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV , imports from the high north are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ach@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this becomes as always difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the north is practical .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; the Fren@@ ch@@ man Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , manages to make it his first use in this season at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot;
the un@@ defeated chil@@ ein Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories against the Club at the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z once again could move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is not enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , not bot@@ tling anyone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
Donald Tru@@ mp was really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his capacity to en@@ act the law , Congress gave a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels har@@ med against the US imp@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , since then , investors of the home OM@@ V , which together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Stream 2 . &quot;
the threat is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp should even raise the sanctions by executive order . &quot;
there are twelve weapons to choose from .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at which the group could wi@@ pe off , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved into the center of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar K@@ iller reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet . &quot;
&quot; the ech@@ el@@ ons three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the newest gu@@ sts of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A focused its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state hol@@ dings and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) , the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
the role of backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply at the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) back into self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
bo@@ iled is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooled .
&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children receive a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last day of the year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served 45 hours of the week are eating at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 p.m .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time employees will have kitchen service from September 1st : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruits , the meal individually , give the food out , clean off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ class facilities - determines the length of the hour .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pe@@ dagog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is very useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the cavi@@ ties - until now also the task of the kitchen shafts - will be done by special cleaning personnel in future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has displayed in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , it is called from the Press Office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours do not fall as much in weight for about 750 persons in the education area , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ man , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ elled in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice trial which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to a consult@@ ative role .
&quot; this year , for the first time , elections will be handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ man said , &quot; &quot; A strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make sure that the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie is concerned about the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow .
&quot; in Scotland , Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products of Hob@@ bies and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that staff and union representatives would be &quot; first to learn &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company leader of the company , the company called &quot; &quot; Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s &quot; , &quot; to express concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react immediately because we value the ongoing commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with colleagues and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and completely . should our operations change at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La Liga will be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not prosec@@ uted in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , having submitted an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago from the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after finishing N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry with the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source is close to the Catal@@ ans mind that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish society at the beginning of this summer &apos;s interest in the PS@@ G Middle @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to withdraw under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; during the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has inten@@ tionally dropped a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the estate number 30 . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , Phone 0@@ 74@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
the police witnessed an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car met him on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and brus@@ hed the guard . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the tour of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him in his lane , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Tour@@ an driver touched the guard rails . &quot;
at the passenger car arose property damage .
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident figures , it can be good that the driver didn &apos;t notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the poll@@ uter , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; dome @-@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regensburg Cathedral atzen will continue for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication to the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he received from the former Regensburg bishop and present car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the dome master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the deputy Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the recognition of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their ignor@@ ant assessment of the processes at that time .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence at the dome @-@ cats with &quot; two kinds of measure . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ ar@@ ia , Histori@@ ker@@ in and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ ar@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rund@@ funk , Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis also meant : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that is a frozen food . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows were a completely normal pe@@ dagog@@ ical means &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to former decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder tape &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the Bishop of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by the domain master R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emoti@@ on@@ ality , punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explained why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of violence &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students are raising his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ on and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible if a domain @-@ treasure brings no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , it is possible to repro@@ ach him , to experience it too late or not to have taken the first hint seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all sur@@ vey@@ ed - literally &quot; &quot; Sal@@ vation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always en@@ camp@@ ed by children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also led to w@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he did not only kno@@ ck with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also gave ear cow@@ boys to the hair or ears , he adm@@ its already years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honour of honour it must be said that such educational methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually is about in this report , the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school are the dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just crashed on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still busy . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the issue of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger dome @-@ cats was reported in connection with the report . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger exposed in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted himself to the dome master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the suffer@@ ers for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
the real problem with the enligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they were not even entrusted with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the scratch students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that out of it ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , tru@@ ste@@ es etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; this is how the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment entrusted him in advance could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of each other . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; was read by the Regen@@ s@@ burger dome @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the former dome master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is presented in the report &quot; &quot; Direc@@ tions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge catch from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is separated clean@@ ly : between the primary school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the dome , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses of violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report has been dealt with incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not conductor of the dome @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; all the horri@@ ble test pe@@ dagog@@ y , the cases in which Kn@@ aben of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and mal@@ igned , all of them took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boy on his face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , like most witnesses , the theme of &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states . &quot;
what was the difference between the gymn@@ asi@@ um and the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the common humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he was just beginning to establish himself and from the predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again about 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ on@@ atal gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , he points out that the punishment is still practi@@ sed in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent stri@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test @-@ pun@@ ish@@ ments were forbidden in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that they took place in a legal grey area , as each one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ sed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say he has always looked away .
this is just not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the death penalty was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pe@@ dagog@@ ical standards to the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating the past to present moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already quite right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was burned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence on innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the ordinary . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means for discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ear @-@ cow@@ boys and ears and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Regensburg period did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of exam@@ in@@ ation@@ ism also included in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts X@@ VI@@ . , tells from his perspective , that the cathedral @-@ cats only played a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not at all deny that he led a rigorous reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly be possible for him to form an institution of world d@@ rank , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singers and before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during their conversations with their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of which one cannot imagine that he could do something too much . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get along with how many ex @-@ dom@@ ain@@ ees still hold contact with him 23 years after his em@@ ir@@ ation , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was strict with them , are thus un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and rever@@ e them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clearly : everything you have given to him are educational methods that were on the agenda back then . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now , the stop would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger dome @-@ cats , finally in peace . &quot;
