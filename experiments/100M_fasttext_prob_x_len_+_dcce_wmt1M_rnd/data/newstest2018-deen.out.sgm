<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel where the S-Bahn tunnels are excavated.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small laborers manage the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a walk-in road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, more detailed maps were used for cities and municipalities, so-called" "Urposition sheets". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian survey administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army chief occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: they were the current neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-Map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drive forward the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian messaging management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The copyright sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was registered 21 years after the creation of the map, thus in 1877, as the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in the outward zooming a small-part card appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered flags from the so-called" "judgment" "from which the cornerstone was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not show farmers there today - but small farmers in the plant "Land in Sonne."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "Gasteig" "or" "On the ventilation" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüties". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden directed the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the Ankle of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later on 500 places were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the power station in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 the children-house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was erected - in architectural allusion to the origins of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered as" "main place" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the bombs of the Allies opened many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days took place and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen rights group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colours issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention while travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently been found throughout the state and noted here."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who are disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people pass."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be stopped because of their skin color, they will be beaten or killed," "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear grievances in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group zipped incidents like racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during his journey and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's office, which shows that the black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be prepared to bring it Caution, or let relatives know they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri reported 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI, the Hassan Crimes Report, which states the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company about housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after countries passed immigration laws to arrest local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration infringements, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Feminist project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen's Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The members of the CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have captured a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the rectangular courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Local Association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members met."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">"on the table of the Feriengaeste, only regionally is coming."</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV-president of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" "fundamental". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit in such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland care for a lot of work, a lot of things must be handled with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and with the topography to fight," "he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead to bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the promotion of leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers need to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and have thought about how they continue to operate," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of their subsidy</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the accounting area is 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs were promoted by the total cost of 71 500 euros, a quarter borne by the community of fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do a really good job without farmers and rural women.</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Coordinance Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state promotion of Weideyeurs.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The pre-requisite is the presence of a flow rate marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fence must not be operated tug (slope gradient over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fishermen's Weill project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the accounting area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the First Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals made by the President on the drastical limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not accept the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have voted him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he attacked their significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta said," I don't want to address a complete story here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporaneous response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your idleness, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who are longing for free to breathe, / the burning waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time when the" "losing trash" "on our screens was better to see."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical figurative portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this long ago."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not invading anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatives that the American flame goes to the murdered world:" Lady Liberty is going forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen from the exhausted, elting but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not illuminate the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power ignited."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Schotten were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Performance Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the World Championships will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special develops" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," "Black said."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route while Eilidh Doyle is elected by the team to team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," "Black says."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it's" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will participate at 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season that was supposed to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" immensely proud "of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates have voted for me and have chosen me, it makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't buzz yourself for a public office if you cannot tolerate the people of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers hit him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he pleaded with criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in the year 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and mute we are led as sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, expressing their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, complained him at the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astounding popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary sharpening head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and play his hairy head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is considered official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hasserted people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest recited the Bible in his mail and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hassertive, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," "she wrote in the commentary section of the broadcast" "The Post." ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people occupy the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor of the governor described as a" "concentrated anti-spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and kill protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"President Trump is sued by Twitter users, who were blocked by his Twitter feed."</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County is the last Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters of letters fell upon its leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous idyll.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticised his position on the treaty of amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance club</seg>

<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua including Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery areal in tumors will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16 at 4.30 a.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporter Tumlingens a concern for their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documentary: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the documents of the document, on the Tumour mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patron was right and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village picture of Tumlingen, the" Berg "is the third, the wonderful settler nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 reinforce this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval period.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a pastor, continued to remain owner of this church and could also inherit this own church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"thus, the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two pieces have been torn between Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were cast and the bell bars were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they removed the pulpit and the church chairs, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were overthrown in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tummy Hilarius Cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from hearers."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split the bell tower and half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower crane still existing today remained as witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serene on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>

<seg id="802">The members want to place tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.</seg>
<seg id="803">"in a first phase until 2018, the association plans" "accessible installations at five to six places" "in Oberharz."</seg>
<seg id="804">"St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber cheese."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be complemented by the internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of a location."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the" "Star Path train" "will be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star path, the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained. "</seg>

<seg id="817">The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto derived to the dwarf-plan - are positioned exactly in the distance and a measure of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">"the Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeter diameter, while the sun is exactly 75 meters away measuring 70 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="820">"while the light from sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the station with Pluto."</seg>

<seg id="868">"still I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause because we have just in the tricky on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well, "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and we don't afford so many playing mistakes in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season virtually with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue may even have something fresh as they would not have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know about 100% where they are currently standing," "says the inner defender of Fortuna."</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish Food Safety Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum process, they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish migration authorities (Migrationsverket) criticized for mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees that were at least age-old."</seg>
<seg id="887">"to date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion that the person is "possibly under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty consistent," "he said to the magazine The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily imply that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases suggesting that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet studied the results published in 581, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year."</seg>

<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used."</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we cannot safely say it, we should not pretend as if we could," "he said to the newspaper Metro."</seg>
<seg id="901">"however, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is incorrect. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules, aimed at preventing unobstructed issues of European football clubs, will not disturb Neymars World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will be added to Paris Saint-Germain by the UEFA, as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars relocation to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make the money loose to sign up Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the rich Herrscherfamily of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must deal with legitimate sources of income that enable them to make the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Plini, after his election as the UEFA President in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that associations, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively deceive and risked to ruin, when banks or owners withdraw their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP depot period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter him from excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"sorry, FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount of accounting for the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the repayments for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of €60 million (back then 82 million dollars), which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the club members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs, which could try to review their financial supervision by blaming their revenue through companies associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a cataran enterprise could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be deemed to be legitimate revenues."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was brought up by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"however, PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will be ambassador to World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easy to figure out for the UEFA regulators."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"so far, the sanctions against PSG will mean that UEFA will be more attentive to every attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police is a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, numerous objects were scanned in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart."</seg>
<seg id="1213">"in doing so, 15 accused were arrested between 25 years and 77 years of age and had already issued an arrest warrant against them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"the officials also ensured large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"against the two suspects, there were German arrest warrants."</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">"in the campaign, Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved."</seg>
<seg id="1219">Altogether over 300 police officers were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, addicted murder, and robbery and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the Office of the Public Prosecutor has been investigating the organised drug trade in the southern German area."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily.</seg>

<seg id="1231">"according to the Register, ten million people have been registered with foreign nationals, including 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>

<seg id="1234">"in individual cases, data from 1921 had been found" "of people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should appear in the register."</seg>

<seg id="1262">Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when they settled the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, because the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the pressure on budgetary income is likely to rise to almost 3% in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But they indicated that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to reap the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also voted to withdraw a part of the mammoth economic package issued one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the upcoming February, although it is said that now it is expected that it will provide $15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"in minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" "in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to pollute consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required for cooling down inflation and a" somewhat larger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank emphasised that increases" "step-by-step" "and" "limited" "would take place."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">"the pound fell by 0.5% to 1,31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1,11 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations on interest rate increase, and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salaries, as the sharpening becomes even worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not" "prevent incomes from incomes," "but she added that the wages at the end of their three-year forecast can be" "clearly". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expenditures."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after the decrease in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the reason.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard pressed households, with three policy makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and it will be tightened again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the exceedance in relation to its target of 2% is "quite" attributable to the weak Pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent decline of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again, as the lenders are looking for shops and end the year in a positive way."</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market is particularly good for those in which the existing dealers are running out and the new mortgages complete, and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) is alleged to prescribe 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pre-positioning prophylaxis (prep) preventative prior to sexual intercourse, which can lessen the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by health care for a first three-year study of estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as" important new intervention, "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be made available to people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prevention prophylaxis (prep) is a series of HIV preparations used prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medication may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"clinics are identified that consent to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, how it is targeted and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"said Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if directed specifically to patients and endangered, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We cordially welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Trust said:" "priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect individuals who are HIV-infected, and that they will contribute to the cessation of the spread of HIV in society a step closer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted Joanne Doom and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over the other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on one another, without having to bend down."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel so that it had the correct height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the seating and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight so that when you push the door up, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials, which give space its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they don't play with your heart."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new chief of staff plans to limit media abstinence from the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if yes, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, met with senior officers on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information entered into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diets.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relation to television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercialism is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when he was upset because of unfair competition, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," said the former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February compared to Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps Twitter's habit under control, according to six former campaign officials is to ensure that his personal consumption of media includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">"perhaps these campaign officials know something we others do not know, that Trumps tweets without their intervention would have included even more combustibles."</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it that Trump has sparked controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Trump material that might promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - completely occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers, the president for strategic reasons to induce doubt."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example written by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he can find out where they originate from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Gotnew.com, the website of the Internet-Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff in Katie Walsh to be the source behind a heap of leaks in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for Schikanen, or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has voiced incorrect allegations in the past and revoked her."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Williams read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former chief of staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still seek influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"with the closing of the Birkenhof hotel through the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also revenues through the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees that came to the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which ensured controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented accommodation from asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"Birgit Scherer's Managing Director, Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>

<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, blankets partly removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is still much to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with spacious showers, the entrance area is remodeled, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later become" "beautifully bourgeois", "as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a conference room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a higher downtown level, emphasizes Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set itself wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, he said."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he is calculating."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outdoor installations are also brought to foreground, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-affair: U.S. Special Agent sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia-affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have deployed a report to a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the panel has recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The radio station CNN reported that there are already first discharges of the Greg in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are accused of acting as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also picked up more and more Trumps's private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the special promoter Trump has personally moved to the centre and discovers whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called "Ankle Chambers."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for consultation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the station CNN, pre-invitations were already issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"in the report, people who participated in the meeting were called upon to testify."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort were there during the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television, that the substitution show that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he should act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new ground for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President, on Thursday night, used a speech in West Virginia to portray Russia's affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the issue gives the democrats a possibility to" feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but these work also usually in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House supports all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to believe that something has changed, it was stated in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rash, accusations against Trump have been loud, he wants to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigations against the former national security advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This deletes speculation about whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired upon prescriptions of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, after which the special agent could no longer be released so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a giant iceberg has loosened itself from the barely seven-fold magnitude of Berlin from the Schelvio."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, which is heavy and 5800 square kilometers, is driving north and will probably need two or three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, is unclear according to research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, for about 30 years, however, there has been a series of unusual bursts of ice cream in the region, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken collision has so far been part of Larsen-C-Schelocks.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelsess floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelocks is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this coward, the balance of waxes and abort occurred several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelvio is torn there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelocks is in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart, if a piece break down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelcows and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it comes after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice cream makes it possible that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in small measure, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI information with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C-Schelcowl is the fourth-largest pillar of the Antarctic."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we have no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists, whether the Larsen-C Schelocks will grow back or go back over the long term, and possibly merged, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers are not tracing the demolition of this giant iceberg on climate change, many kingfishers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has heated by around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Minister of Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German rescue organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team worked effectively with men's hands in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express himself in detailed allegations of the Italian public prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only evaluate all allegations that are currently being raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew will ship dinghy migrants, which are delivered directly by men's hands, and that the smugglers can depart for the ships to be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles in front of Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not have" "significant changes or disabilities" "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel Prize winner organisation is Doctor without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants, who arrived in Italy after the emergency relief measures, declined strongly in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have taken fruits."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer bikers, the" Berlin outposts "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in Nordpfalz for four days of trials and sightseeings."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were repeatedely long ascents, for the long tribulations."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again vantage point at the lookout point, connected by" "flew" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, there were again many altimeters."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inlets brought a welcome break."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathe in the open air inhaler curative brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was driven.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 km and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of turf - Bundesliga equipment for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, the sports stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium quickly in case of wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also recognised the first federal ligaars who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"at the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg took place, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire completely new young audiences for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," that there are still many clubs rising on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup organizes the first" Interactive Club World Cup "in London where gamers from different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"apart from Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now providing an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online more often than to send the Bundesliga to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in the e-sport, computer games like" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or even the football simulation FIFA are being challenged at competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sport, Ligen has long since established itself, in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, E-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly used to get used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobanky also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that you also find in classical sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"furthermore, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also train their body and respect the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitty player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobatic also sees problems:" "doping becomes more and more a topic." ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform at online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the road internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertaining Software (BIU) suggests that E-sport requires rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to lie at 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"in addition to the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte consultant. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports event provider Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot happening in Europe too.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school E-sport has been introduced as a pedagogue, says Frobank."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the soccer league clubs, according to Dutt, are meanwhile required to set up an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"just to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," says Dutt. "</seg>
<seg id="1656">It is not possible to hold onto that only in football everything remains as it was always.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Poison-Eggs - Egg alternatives for cooking and baking</seg>
<seg id="1658">"from the scandal over poisonous eggs, almost all federal states are now affected."</seg>
<seg id="1659">Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and took all the eggs from the sale in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"in regiments only eggs are to be taken, which are demonstrably no fix."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was convicted in June due to negligent killings of Conrad Roy, who took her life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing:" "my family is inconsolable."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, folded hands and eyes directed, when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have changed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any repentance."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carter's lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance, which she completely deplores." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy that said that there is" no day, in which I do not enter the loss of my beloved Son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Gary's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was" "persecuted" "by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this only person, with whom I have been together since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to invite others to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon dioxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed, that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, springy from a building, arise yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" you must do it, Conrad "and" Everything you need to do is to switch the generator and you'll be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the event by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox was a member of Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimme: learning from the New Mini-Lame of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">The fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain for the Audi Cup is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern traut a big season for the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation is not harming.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"something was different on his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimme immediately, even though the additional piece of clothing was very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm, and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen, he made the tied bandage to the arm."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach did not announced it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first deployment as Bavaria captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the stand could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the coach could also indicate Kimi so.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the C-Elf existing C-Elf from youth players, Debutants and just out of holiday, but he."</seg>
<seg id="1698">It is best to distribute sugars to those you want to keep in your spirits.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Those who were chosen to compete for the heir of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.</seg>
<seg id="1700">"Kimme confirmed," This is what you want as a player: take responsibility. "</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old as a mini-lahm scored over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"right behind, that is now its position, the white binding on the arm did its rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and in general, Kimme worked as the one who can best take the rudder in his hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayable troops."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the view of the whole, while many others were busy with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal thus to replay his lack of fitness (folding hardly); Renato Sanches started to tie at Teufel come out to the achievements of the Asia-journey (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süver so that in their first appearance in the Bavaria-jersey not to be negative.</seg>
<seg id="1707">This all worked very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süver ran along Kimme, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli Storm was often difficult, and Süver also tried a few times in the build-up."</seg>
<seg id="1710">"his colleague Rudy admits that" "the result" "was not as we expected it."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed decent performance at the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"relocation, tempo change:" for this style I was also brought up. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as usual, this Bavaria-World is still for the newcomers, one saw in connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Rudy, for example, was not one or two in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimmy said goodbye to a couple of crisp statements in his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard an interesting sentence from Süver:" what is going on here, I have already noticed. "</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still business secretary of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">"this shows itself after more than a year, in which the new economic Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office."</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and enterprises from the region speak on T V-request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprise (VTU), says:" "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy, the Lemke has altogether blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest turn-turn looks natus in infrastructure policy: the junction of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"still this year, the ministry hopes for a planning process, until 2021 is expected to be the construction law."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Tracing of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the federal road network plan."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to start the route in December 2020, says Cornelia Holtmann's Minister of Foreign Affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"of course, natus sees a sign for supporting regional, but internationally competitive enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Commerce (IHK) aims at Trier as von Wissing, with the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that has been sagging for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="1736">"in addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, the Chamber commences."</seg>
<seg id="1737">"in the new master bonus, the Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach."</seg>
<seg id="1738">"intended is a premium of 1000 Euro for the passed master exam and 2500 Euros, if graduates are self-employed within ten years of the master's training."</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">"in the planned road construction, quickly facts are to be created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan gloauer, chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"up to now, 56 new engineers who want to employ Wissing in the state-of-the-art mobility have only been occupied at 29 locations."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber of Industry asks for more jobs to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">"according to this, CDU Group vice-president Christian Baldauf is referring to the calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a concept of the country to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"furthermore, the present broadband expansion in the country is sobering."</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"but the nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of the car manufacturer to install equipment for neutralising the exhaust gases caused by diesel vehicles also increase, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of having to indulge in the mighty car companies and to ignore signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"the companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so-called depolding equipment that could regulate emissions in order to meet the regulations when a car was tested, but retracted with normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several employees of Volkswagen were charged; others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1796">"it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the lavender is declining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought, and because of the diseases transmitting insects, what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, are causing great headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the Weekly Riodoce normally meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings range."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and while in the whole country the corpses accumulate, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken his office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is their editor and their inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smile face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists rarely be tried in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inseparable and although the terrain is now even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Why, we mistruct everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But to the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rivaling factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first there was the publication of an interview with Damascus, Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzmans's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed vein members bought every copy of the issue, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for North Africa in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drugs problem, "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez has won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up willingly that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task you become a journalist, either that or you play the dummy."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love to the routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, there were suddenly no cell phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the Governor referred to as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has spread to three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposure to the government spending, concentrating on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor's office, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political layers almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers to protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Allame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become more louder throughout the country by writing in organised protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked her to re-divide it from the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco-Journalism", "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on command of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell:" "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones are in addition to their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting at the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer than at once all of their phones were to be summoned."</seg>
<seg id="1913">"a number of shootings with taperivals and security forces near the town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead."</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of Kartell embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the kerbstone edge, they published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens howl near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept watch, to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visibly visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed its mark."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," "said Bojorquez," "If on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, though a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian mountain craftsman were so well received that experts described it as" "Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs". ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that they could even find that its scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it would have had something of a" "restless past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" "Current Biology" "described it as" "the whispering dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodossir that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well-preserved state has astonished researchers, who describe it as" "truly remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock out of the platform, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature was to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that this herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shield technique known as counterweight, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mingle better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say what is suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature of the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now featured in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shade, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs of enough pressure was hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs that the evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shade - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalled that these nodosages were exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been predators of the Cretaceous period," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it did as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosr is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just play a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time, as huge diodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal of Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the thoughtful armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored herbivores was weakened by Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house crates still cover hollowly armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I get it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"clogged remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>

<seg id="1976">"at first, there is no information about the exact number of publishers."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was a slight to moderate injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident point.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing sits in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1994">"one simply confirms by mobile phone, that it is taken to occupy the seat and thus devaluates the ticket."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test run runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"at the beginning of next year, it is expected to be available on many other long haul routes in Germany," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the train the card devaluation without conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, some requirements must be met: one needs a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like this: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket below" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customer then appears a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and occupied the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when the driver's ticket control comes to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so one can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silence."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, check out in the DB Navigator just by myself."</seg>

<seg id="2012">"who often drives train, knows that besides delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the biggest nuances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"however, in any case, one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents necessary for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the identity card, or any other document you have to submit."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train escort and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the departement or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the artist at the end time to take care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment, letting them rent and scrolled through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police had just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since no one had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retched on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lebare body that was stretched out on the road and stayed there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police and people screamed, and by a man who claimed to be Browns father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she observed a live feed, where a policeman faced a group of demonstrators with a dog barking."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman took his rifle and screamed:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," "Ferrell remembered her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists of the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a culmination of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution know and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a latent racism, she is no different from the next black women-child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel I would have a bad service, to keep them away from them."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter settled with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's figure.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism was totally changed after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt-occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other local people the team of" Whose Streets? "followed in the years to Brown's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious candidate of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr's's life as she loves and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, who have shaped the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "chosen by Ferrell on account of her identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shaved this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the message cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clings herself to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers are discussing bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit Gallery moves people, even though it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area, since the first presentation of 2009, divides the population into supporters and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves the topic.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" needs no man "(Siggi Boccupy) or simply simply:" megalomania "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the other shops profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will be the end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the peasant market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the maids are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery resettles, comes to the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low with the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping bags in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rental companies are often not portable to a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special deals are almost no longer there and that which is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall is not suitable for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant Markthalle take place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit gallery previously to distribute all stores from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "this simply won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - how I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer a place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching likeness: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble - hung on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupmarkers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being publicly classified as secret diplomatic notifications of the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Stresa lance (A suitable resemblance)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and landmark dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, though some intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 counts including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a Körniges, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't be photographed at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA-portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal bridges that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a Comic" Suppressed Images, "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would convert chelated judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, Tweetable ways to inflame the rigid divisions which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a particular reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with its oversized signature among them (the" i "in their family name has been provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence, a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scholar of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, late Memories, too."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic-novels mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how it appears in the hands of the disciplinarian barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they create your speech, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacons, which rally like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Mannings stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea, like the movement, which also stuck behind her liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of University of Northwestern and one of Oxford University Employees for Killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) warrant for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the County Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A Community warning system issued by the police authorities of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the action, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">She has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lait had now been certified and excluded from entering the Campus of the Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal affair which is examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an email explaining that" "we are in contact with the UK police in the UK to help US investigators in any way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip which said that something had happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27, too."</seg>
<seg id="2177">Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the Management Team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants:" "the police currently works on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will finish the WADA timetable in the near future" - Russian vice-president Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian vice-champion Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti-doping agency (Russian).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA timetable was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA timetable for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for re-establishment of Rusada and recently published on the website of the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause anxiety to Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything will be implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian law Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in regards to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"mutall words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day Smirnov reported problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2194">"nobody seems to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"during the course of the Doping scandal, Rusada was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in Moscow in July, WADA CEO, Olivier Niggli, stated that Rusada went" in the right direction, "in order to be used again."</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"and even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed."</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people out of the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint-hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers permit to circumvent the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?"

<seg id="2212">"saved as a favorite to look at new things you post... | Hello, just wanted to mention, I liked this article. it was funny. keep oon posting! |"</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the Snap Surveys and Polls from specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can reboot, why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Industry may have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the Finance website Let's Talk Payments."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and recognise bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Falles in Miskoredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made" pulse "surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the main executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has seized the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"when a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and processes and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submitting a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now, as the company Convercent uses Convercent, problems that were previously concealed by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair trainees more quickly identified and addressed."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2348">"over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who were to have participated directly in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara following this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overthrow the army as a" gift of God, "as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan made another 7395 state-earners moist by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted on their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002 Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least under the appeal to the reforms of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not be even crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking its Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr. Sharkey when releasing his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as best as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixated on conversation or she can be" in mood! ""</seg>

<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy is with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "means it on the site."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing sophistication refer to something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission than optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is permeated out of the zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the devoured body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>

<seg id="2539">"he reports about varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it amazes him that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as the Lower Construction Law Authority, the applicant has to submit relevant certificates."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good company climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens."</seg>

<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>

<seg id="2555">With Haslachs own Bauhof and gardening company can be reacted flexibly to many.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble under monument protection stands, it is important to" "have an eye on what fits", "when new buildings are approved, the waning city builder emphasises."</seg>

<seg id="2561">"also that his successor is staying for a long time, Wacker wants:" we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the job. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good company climate, but also for the further development of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"who would like to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to information from Haslach, have a completed course of studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree with specialising in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building instruction and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting the US approximately 1.3 million and in the UK, 300,000, causes gastric cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of triggering ignition, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments were found that a type of tolerance inducing immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel, if the same system also affects people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"post-doctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem which was not housed separately."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it supposes that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how bacteria proliferated on the immune system, the researchers left L. Cross in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - on immaturated immune cells, isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice, and that most of us L. Cross are protected in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. Cross develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to South Lawn for an event that American manufacturing rises last month costs taxpayers according to the military's specifications, which were left to the TIME magazine up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter set in Connecticut was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a firetruck from Wisconsin and a fork-lift truck from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the Chronicle of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long stayed until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids Federal Offices to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "said the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impulse to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government rules."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are required to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"but to demand its use only for a photo-operation, is unusual."</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential car was running in front of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the presidential car through its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- showing the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as Trump at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 in the White House conducted 58 practice landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event was the training demand for the flight crew for the month, said an officer."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopters flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers did not exceed the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to hourly rates of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D however amounts to USD 24.380 per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for the reimbursement sets is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things that are made in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is appropriate to emphasize that.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter, when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shone with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Cathedral atzen will continue for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, he received from the former Regensburg bishop and present cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the dome master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the deputy Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the recognition of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their ignorant assessment of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" "Osservatore Romano", "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting on violence at the dome-cats with" two kinds of measure. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"no one doubt that it is" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scararia, Historikerin and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scararia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also meant:" we are happy to go to the church and that is a frozen food. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" blows were a completely normal pedagogical means "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards to former decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the misuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the reminder tape" "My brother the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the Bishop of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that by the domain master R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explained why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "incidents of violence" "at the" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students are raising his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a cholerion and perfectionist, who became more tangible if a domain-treasure brings no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to reproach him, to experience it too late or not to have taken the first hint seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all surveyed - literally" "Salvation," "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony," "sincere", "" sincere, "" competent "and" intelligible, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always encamped by children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to wutches."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only knock with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also gave ear cowboys to the hair or ears, he admits already years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honour of honour it must be said that such educational methods in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, with parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually is about in this report, the horrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school are the dredging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is a question of whether it is not more familiar with his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just crashed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still busy."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger dome-cats was reported in connection with the report."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger exposed in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the dome master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of the sufferers for the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even entrusted with parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scratch students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this:" "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that out of it... Buben intrusive or clearer or even more open than compared to their parents, dormitory leaders, trustees etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"this is how the report concludes with the very clear result:" "that the students and / or their environment entrusted him in advance could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of each other."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradictory crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violent excesses" "was read by the Regensburger dome-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former dome master Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report" "Directions". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge catch from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is separated cleanly: between the primary school and the gymnasium of the dome, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence as well as, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report has been dealt with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not conductor of the dome-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which Knaben of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and maligned, all of them took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boy on his face when they were already on the gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, like most witnesses, the theme of" "primary school" "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" heavenly "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was the difference between the gymnasium and the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" many victims underestimated the common humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most, the reproach remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again about 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domonatal gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this regard, he points out that the punishment is still practised in the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent striding."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test-punishments were forbidden in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that they took place in a legal grey area, as each one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the death penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" fall of anachronism, "that is, the danger of evaluating the past to present moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was burned in the pre-school of adversity and violence on innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the ordinary."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take the protection of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means for disciplining and punishing, i.e. ear-cowboys and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger play with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of examinationism also included in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells from his perspective, that the cathedral-cats only played a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not at all deny that he led a rigorous regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible for him to form an institution of world drank, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, one makes no big singers and before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during their conversations with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger thoroughly and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of which one cannot imagine that he could do something too much."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get along with how many ex-domainees still hold contact with him 23 years after his emiration, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he was strict with them, are thus unequivocally in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up and revere them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clearly: everything you have given to him are educational methods that were on the agenda back then."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the stop would be a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger dome-cats, finally in peace."</seg>
