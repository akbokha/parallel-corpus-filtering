28 @-@ year @-@ old cook in San Francisco Mall found dead
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping center .
&quot; the brother of the victim told him that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia , from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ at@@ ric medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a chef at S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were shock@@ ed and destroyed on the ground .
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank initially lived in hostels , but that , &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia stated that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; connecting his family to his family was to always cook something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond , who sh@@ one bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is requested to call the F @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now unmistak@@ ably clear .
&quot; I will always be put in drawers or get stuck from the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a television with a loud dru@@ mming and Mexican food , is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she raises the question about the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from the 25th of August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses reminded me of their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the for@@ age trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at that speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he was able to lead his family over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not hesitate for photo purposes . &quot;
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid ran@@ ged the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the golden pyramid of sport .
there is no lack of awards to the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen liked him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it will not only be awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young people for decades .
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ times US master winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes are Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the fen@@ ders Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , the jumping @-@ runner Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tru@@ mp would rather remain small and cau@@ tious about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ vert regulations , and he is fighting for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot;
the democratic candidate has announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; so , on Tru@@ mp , there could be no party discussions . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ operate the coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ ce trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , they don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they are to be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ ust , then he says he cannot be changed . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics argue , that the budget deficit would only be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who flee alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ sed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women sitting .
each one has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curious in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a responsible for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the theme of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oul@@ try .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for single @-@ wing women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs joined the organisation together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically , because they thre@@ aten them torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ bear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is no rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they come into Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not want to help , there is more accommodation for them only for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
the seven district governments in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ al@@ z and Upper Fran@@ conia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , only escaped women are not accommodated isolated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ conia , there are some common stories of stories or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separate from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ med separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together , it can lead to - persistent - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the washing rooms should be separated and readily accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much women feel this need of protection , one can read at the rush , which there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
general Assi@@ stance in Assi@@ stance : demands for new employment campaigns
assistant doctors called their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work measures in early September .
the J@@ DC said that it had been meeting ministers to address the concerns about the treaty .
&quot; in July , Assi@@ stance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favor of the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; &quot; har@@ sh@@ ly &quot; &quot; to problems , which led to the refusal of the Treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes caused Assi@@ stance to fight for six times this year , the first total waste in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A assistant doctor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed treaty conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistance doctors and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt told that the contract for physicians in England would be enforced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated ball@@ room of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace , I cannot deny that Ankara would most like this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin sm@@ iled sm@@ iles and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved like that would never happen . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introduc@@ tory words : the dow@@ ning of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
&quot; to rebuild the v@@ eto@@ ire becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
&quot; the alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s ap@@ ologies he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could win a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an mainly needs all the friends he can get after he was given the last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his ministry .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are picked up again . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ colonial assault on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry with the West , as the reaction to the attempted power of power was regarded as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the continued gru@@ dge over the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara with security , the Russian state of states won a bonus for him that he demanded support for the selected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to show how an analy@@ st was once described as an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that have driven away from the west and treated badly and now alli@@ ed themselves . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents announced at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have stri@@ ped the topic . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally avoided reply to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland &apos;s customers
according to the Bank Chairman of the Bank the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan granted the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; the Bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ated since then , when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time , brand strategi@@ sts have used R@@ BS to protect other end @-@ users . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for retail business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he said to the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer continue to sponsor the Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , for how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Management Board . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached Pre@@ dil@@ ection its 3,@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys Champagne after a double at New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he set on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ die , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that New@@ market has done it , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pic@@ ks up the che@@ ers when he gets the victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle races - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ day winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by @-@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career stages &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone reached only a few ahead of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusiasts have been thrilled for this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already scored 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and great tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden in GB for nearly 30 years which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve w@@ re@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of great tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
&quot; and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50,000 years . &quot;
Russian President ur@@ ges Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the narrow@@ est confidence @-@ circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is said that Putin ordered Ivan@@ ovo &apos;s dism@@ iss@@ al from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without stating any reasons . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the cler@@ k and staff of the Government staff . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state with respect to draft bills and controls for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
&quot; Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked Ivan@@ ov to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
persu@@ ade the smiling faces ?
this step has mysteri@@ ously swe@@ pt Moscow .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and worked as he worked for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust post four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he most trusted . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of office would have viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , closest ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical confrontation at the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons is written out of the series , which is followed by a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g was with it since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication published on Friday . &quot;

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a Ban@@ ff resident called for assistance in identifying fish that emerged in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish@@ ings around San@@ da@@ als could be sp@@ itted by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge connected now with Fi@@ fe
&quot; the $ 1,@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 &quot;
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sl@@ ant ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Kei@@ th Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Cross@@ ings Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total amount of bridge is in their place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete base in Ros@@ y@@ th today for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter represents forward @-@ looking high @-@ tech and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck in the extension , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or south side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive because the Vi@@ a@@ duct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards by about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they che@@ ered only a few millimeters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
&quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; still alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the manager of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boat without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but these were loos@@ ely loos@@ ened by the crew of the boat , who controlled the boat . &quot;
&quot; today , someone has wo@@ ke about these men . &quot;
seriously injured - a man har@@ rows his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholi@@ zed perpetr@@ ators cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old , the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ arm@@ oured his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
&quot; on the road , they met the man &apos;s potentially explosive companion . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ pped his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens said : in future , investors should be taken into duty much more in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; Action Concept &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot;
but controversy is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a scheme is missing up to now .
&quot; said Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will have to exhibit 20 percent of all homes as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute in the town hall is , however , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot;
a new municipal housing construction program that will cost millions of dollars and still has to be financed should provide incentives .
&quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; despite this , so Brat@@ mann , making a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; the programme is not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one blow the problem could be solved .
for in the western city run for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the western city is increased dras@@ tically again , one can be removed from the aim of so @-@ called mixture . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; indeed , I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; as a teen@@ ager and child no longer want to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , many have been compl@@ aining about many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later arose a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tur@@ key and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game resulted in a significant increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person ref@@ uses every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who followed 3@@ 5.000 users recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; to be &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day &quot; &quot; sti@@ cking on de@@ af ears because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people who are el@@ ap@@ pointing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ aces that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us reason to do sports as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be reduced with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the Active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to campaign title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ es@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es turns on the Swedish bar during the single @-@ multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting a final test in Brazil , a contest that wasn &apos;t so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not going back with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after having won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i retired as excl@@ am@@ ation mark . &quot;
&quot; although it insi@@ sted that during their long road to the top , never to have planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ o &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ afa was slightly guided by two twi@@ sts , the picture dec@@ eased . &quot;
Schwe@@ be@@ amed and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world title .
&quot; she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the cable @-@ beam again - and put one on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her en@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured out on glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner than the vision she once described in her book book . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ mans &apos; performance was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ulated , which is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans . &quot;
&quot; after her ground exercise , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ oths to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial killer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first bloody attack of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed and two more wounded in His@@ panic residential areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; commented Howard of the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ rons and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; however , like the least of its ageing , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let myself down .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her were told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognise her , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still make &apos; , &apos; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund addressed to &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language with , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some character alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I have been asked for a long time after the pro@@ g@@ nosis , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause for rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced Gover@@ nor to call on the state on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rain@@ falls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ds after extreme rain@@ falls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards stated that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the congregations affected .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that requests for high water craft , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is deployed across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service sil@@ ently caused that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches in rain in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ ite river near the Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record level over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the nearby Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these flows only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ ey , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still ski@@ pped people out of the flood tide in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , asc@@ ended overnight . &quot;
he said that another step @-@ man who lives near was warned .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water poured out and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were staying until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread quickly , as there continued to be heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground was considerably su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ds caused the res@@ cu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a breakdown in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ator in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa threw 200 floo@@ ded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were both floo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were flus@@ hed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses had been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Kei@@ th Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; blown away from bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents reported that Brown suffered several fir@@ ing injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport . &quot;
&quot; he did a lot , his little body was blown through by spheres , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores told Mel@@ ende@@ z the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is likely to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 year old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reported the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ators could be found .
&quot; investig@@ ators condemned C@@ BS Philadelphia , that apparently there was a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; cartridge Sle@@ eves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , paraly@@ zed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was definitely an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were sleeves . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seem to be several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di to the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also made in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and police report@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video , according to reports . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color inspir@@ ational . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ ś@@ cian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this crew finally mirrors the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tik@@ routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ fight event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so gymn@@ as@@ tics do not look out all over the country . &quot;
Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymn@@ asts are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily in private gymn@@ asts which are maintained by parents who pay for training , alignment , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ ast for 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international champi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asts that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the hol@@ ing of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , f@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted in a vote refused . &quot;
&quot; in July , H@@ unt announced plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS found itself in a &quot; &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the maintenance of the day @-@ to @-@ day delivery times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance , shared the last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have made serious concerns about the proposed deal , especially that it will hei@@ gh@@ ten the current staff crisis and meeting it to treat all physicians appropriately . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes due to discussions with the government on the reluc@@ tance to take part and sometimes to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now to raise the up@@ surge and address the worries of the assistant physicians .
&quot; should he not do this , the Assistant Doc@@ tors made it clear that they are willing to carry out further action measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw an up@@ surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100.000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were involved in providing doctors on the strike @-@ chain cover . &quot;
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , urged the assistant to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work campaigns achieve nothing but little , but poll@@ ute already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the past two months , we spoke to the committee of assistants and responded positively to concerns regarding the incident and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine , which can reduce heart attack risk &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ ag@@ itation medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot;
the NI@@ CE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls causing covers .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solve , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the draft of NI@@ CE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by the people with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of ble@@ eding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness ev@@ okes election fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored as a dis@@ continued government report today .
&quot; the former Cab@@ inet of Cab@@ inet Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , verb@@ ally attacks the police , ob@@ struc@@ ted ob@@ servers and the general councils to ignore the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; intoler@@ ance regarding eth@@ ni@@ cities and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now a cor@@ rupted king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have an ID with themselves , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; currently , a vot@@ er must only name its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests to apply non @-@ removable inks to the finger of a person , when they give up their votes to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it requires that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but should also protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes along with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets fran@@ chise in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be given to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the ground , that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation , in which one person chooses another person . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding out ways to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ jan background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... governmental institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour based on &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate letter selection documents to stop &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration reviews to prevent the electoral system being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
non removable ink on the finger of a person use as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible to participate .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic postal code .
prohibition that political activists edit complete letter @-@ elections and envel@@ opes from wall@@ ets .
police force the authority to set up gates for election stations .
a change in legislation that facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Public Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photo ban in electoral stations .
request that only English can be used in the poll@@ s ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff rule the rule that voters go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case no penalty was placed .
&quot; the election court l@@ ent Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high demands of criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; of the election registri@@ es of the Town Hall . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , our country carries a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and hidden prolifer@@ ation of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come across the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the border and the band who turned out to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger der Herz@@ og@@ in .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to fight for gold , which has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if you are allowed to believe in the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympics that show more than a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood @-@ famous gods . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the run@@ way , many people on the internet point out how a certain ar@@ cher might be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the pool , the South African S@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one hall@@ way t@@ aller : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another long @-@ lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nicely , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal race Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova exhibits more than just the sun @-@ b@@ illed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the gymn@@ as@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own wonderful , wide smile , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter appeared fast and hard at which many were talking about him

you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of the 90 times with the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we deeply regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they are broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly with our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate formulation . By@@ ron does what he said is very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s s@@ quad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have moved to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by lady who ta@@ sted in the middle of business sham@@ elessly under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked like she looked at it , pulled it off and put them back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she continued to browse , and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone . &quot;
&quot; the pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman pro@@ bi@@ med the under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried to under@@ wear ling@@ erie , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she picked up a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ho@@ ck trousers and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that her did not fall , attracted again and went out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone - or think about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how reluc@@ t@@ antly to think that someone would take home shor@@ ts that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to draw the pieces of clothing from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and not washed her .
&quot; one speaker at Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happening on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Federation in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you approach you from behind , you should first turn around so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then strike it with the knee in the bar and twist it while the att@@ acker compl@@ ains of pain , the gun out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as they set up the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what it is doing in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est thing to hand over your money , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;

&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to det@@ ra@@ ct the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toil@@ ette that has been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he dist@@ rac@@ ted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling around the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to train stations to rin@@ se kno@@ bs of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under one sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was just in line with his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample show showed a lumin@@ ometer count of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to that , the lumin@@ ometer value is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ aires were more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; That comes the worst thing that I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; I &apos;m not going to lick anything here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we carried crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming which ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing the film , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had spot@@ ted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the ek@@ el@@ ly Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to pun@@ ish them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these fil@@ thy le@@ aks on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of respon@@ dents were associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of the stomach and the intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they would at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys from Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung welfare @-@ apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of dis@@ comforts of her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; having been removed from their property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were hung acc@@ using holes , wooden beams were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive crying , stri@@ pping and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood floors were ri@@ pped up . &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall Housing dism@@ issed her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was acclaimed by ligh@@ tened neighbors , saying that their life was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They killed nobody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family agreed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the church building , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing is always the last step taken into consideration Corn@@ wall housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church who have been courage@@ ous on us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope this development will don@@ ate comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ zing on the floor
&quot; workers of the house administration will now have to put gar@@ bage inn , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received fine fine after she found guilty of ow@@ ning a class B drug in merchant vision .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 at a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police said that they will del@@ o@@ ze rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can accept themselves without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as to those who have been damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;
tourists in Portugal transferred to panic after a ti@@ dy military jet flies off
&quot; sun@@ bath@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ gal P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the air forces put an unbelievable pl@@ ough
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk . &quot;
this was the moment when the frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after a ti@@ led jet drops over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew near the sun@@ bath@@ ers on the beach section of Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up as they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was surfing around and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the airplane came out of darkness and incredibly deep flew .
&quot; today , the Portuguese airline forces stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility of the area , the aircraft flew lower than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , while four people were also killed on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which restri@@ cts his view . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the re@@ play increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
the Dou@@ ble@@ sp@@ inner must for@@ ego in the strengthening of the Cup with the inferior C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europa League Champion on N@@ ey@@ mar who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing .
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , whereby the demand for Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen will compete for the status as number one for two years . &quot;
coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision in this respect so far and made Bra@@ vo in the league but T@@ er chairs in most other applications .
&quot; before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing . &quot;
&quot; in turn , Sev@@ ille took the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in its own league to Table Tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the World Ranking first took the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als tournament and the Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
&quot; as expected , the two Chinese made it into the final game and made the title among themselves . &quot;
so it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs , they had no aches . &quot;
they had pulled back to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches up here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts were posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected swe@@ eping match .
but nonetheless there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing had appe@@ aled to a ri@@ pp@@ le injury after this in a medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have turned into a similarly high table tennis age of Olympia @-@ Fourth .
Donald Tru@@ mp adm@@ its ″ mighty issues ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has now made weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the multi @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently occurring mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the fight for White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ icals that he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his well @-@ known media shi@@ mm@@ ers again . &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ ies
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ us from June , Tru@@ mp and his competi@@ tor came from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; as end@@ anger , Arizona and Georgia are also considered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview by the sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tru@@ mp replied to the question how he wanted to stop the march of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it is fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of living .
&quot; according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to paint money to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better results . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans would push more under the arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : thre@@ ef@@ old Sc@@ am in D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
&quot; after a fraud test in a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a prototype in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked IO@@ C for information on the case to impose its own investigation into IA@@ AF .
&quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said the IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed the sample and signed , &quot; &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the accreditation of the athletes , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics Leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been with@@ drawn from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is alleged to have informed athletes from his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya is already under special observation at IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences since a long time .
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2,000 D@@ oping targets launched by the IO@@ C before the Rio Olympics , it was unusual beforehand that especially athletes of Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer Games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; subsequently , W@@ A@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with W@@ A@@ DA regulations . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that D@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sporting fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had raised in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type area @-@ wide and systematically sub@@ contracted . &quot;
Russia athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Master@@ piece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins Music really in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Mary is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormously large person .
&quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it .
&quot; we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful nowadays as they did at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl that joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family knew her family about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria several weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other girls from east London entered a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS milit@@ ant in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain the candidate for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the country &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a phone conference that he would expect Clinton to choose Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have spoken to Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , re@@ public@@ ans blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp is un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants N@@ ude Calendar for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to publish a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine distinguishes itself from Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that the Calendar does .
&quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for publication of the cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; who does not suit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the President of the Association thinks Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh occurrence of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already convic@@ ted Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds two months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks came to it . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further repres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees himself in their own country produces refugees , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the head of the association lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining cur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the head of the association demanded that the German government positioned itself &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ critics . &quot;
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit himself and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ aries , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; like the newspaper , calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks had already presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; on the reporting date 30 June , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recru@@ ited as asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey there are not those who pay for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; going where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; until 2021 , the parliamentary elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid as far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ election campaigns - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters are on holiday .
&quot; most of the tourists travelling in the country , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems arise : in the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate air ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and end voices in the end , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave the election campaign shortly before the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , Leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the countryside , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it already did his legendary German predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel has the blame on the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create that &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the good office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel on major manifest@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s German district is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other German states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is a pity not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , so , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country you need to take the base away , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the sides of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campaign co@@ co@@ operates on his comrades , however , is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ fi@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , each birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is on stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to an especially dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just scar@@ cely before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and put their bal@@ lot into the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the President of the state , Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral comb@@ at@@ ants embar@@ k on search for local vocal folds among the holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer under lock
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and finish only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site was scheduled to reloc@@ ate to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
&quot; the award will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft entran@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted , and with it the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again made , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fan@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the transit traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the re@@ organization . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cas@@ u@@ alties were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were fra@@ ying in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality demanded more reinforcement of the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed of the situation . &quot;
there have already been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 km kilometres in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved further , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is open again for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; however , that the B 27 re@@ organization has led to revenue out@@ breaks , each one you ask is scrut@@ ini@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; the cat@@ erer is missing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most powerful are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; road renovation took its operation &quot; &quot; back two years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to dism@@ iss him .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint : otherwise , the restaurant benef@@ itted from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it also has to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where such a kind of funding has been handled . &quot;
&quot; with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars look less frequently now because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the fact that his trunk @-@ clim@@ bers return back to the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about that . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of counter @-@ terrorism , it is constantly screw@@ ed to laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a th@@ icker security package . &quot;
but what does a deb@@ tor state have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
they are demanding no one .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I am involved . &quot;
&quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gave a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions on the Security in the Republic . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the un@@ encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger information and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is launching a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants to pun@@ ish terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still believes it is reasonable and does not demand anything in the case of coalition partners anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented in Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
sometimes they have in themselves : he plans fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for imprisonment of people before deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees that are picked up in a targeted way , should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; at D@@ ul@@ ings for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than before - about those who commit crimes or throw their papers away deliberately to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some also works un@@ even and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
and things that people deeply under@@ went could not be cl@@ inging up in election times .
the inner security is enormously moved into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly in position on the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ter argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère w@@ ills here too for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a return from a double @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t keep anything . &quot;
we discussed the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not useful .
&quot; and with a ban on bur@@ ka , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it is still necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could cause dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to gain inner security in the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel kindly sign@@ al@@ ises the willingness to talk and say , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
&quot; in spite of diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers rise worldwide . &quot;
&quot; however , not all markets are running smoothly . &quot;
&quot; with the recall campaign , there is a vor@@ tex around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can forward a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ened especially in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the total sales , such as the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; head of Sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey , the British vote on withdrawal from the EU also explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the ab@@ at@@ ement escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus of be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the main state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art brand of the Lower Saxony is further worse by the diesel @-@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler further reported sales plans from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time , around the world 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting in the workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the conversion , VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after conversion , the car driver set up a &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as indicated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for rep@@ airing diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA .
&quot; deviations of it will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting , no deterior@@ ations will occur and all relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , a half year after conversion , customers can come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interests of customers , too , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal would cause uncertainty about possible warran@@ ties as indicated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; bank CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it : normal savers would not have to fear , to pay for their austerity penalty . &quot;
&quot; storing banks money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposits or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he ski@@ pped 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not understand . &quot;
&quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; said the Chief Executive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs are now far@@ ther on . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash simply lie in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four times , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank president . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear them alone , &quot; &quot; economically , not possible &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with complaints for deposits of more than three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private customers to pay flat fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
a bank@@ ers said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is endow@@ ed with a bit more luxuri@@ ant .
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if they feed money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branch offices in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; is currently no more known banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( BV@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is dro@@ pping the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not like this in the width .
destination She@@ ets : who bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle aged dear plates .
&quot; before you rush to comment arrow to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ a men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but is due to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older records keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a humble grey suit and gra@@ cious before I stop , hold my hands and say something more determining as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings in which once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic panel special@@ is@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to gauge their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data count : two young women , three men of middle age ) ins Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I &apos;m selling are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , in which I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets to apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media body , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have led to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the talks I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to trailers of the plate revision of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that plate business offers a so@@ othing fellowship of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took off in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans of record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , of objects , the happy youth @-@ inn@@ ings w@@ aking up . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s the case with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to mentally deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; in@@ still@@ ing a staff from a record stack . &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I was bl@@ em@@ ing through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle age ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; trophy &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound board so that I can put them into a shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ like . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who are only slowly coming . &quot;
&quot; f@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the sound board almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and women middle @-@ aged . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ tet Pop instead of experimental jazz yo@@ kes from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange , but na@@ ï@@ ve psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it &apos;s more of a shop window than buying a big shopping basket .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of board lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the impression to dress the jeans under@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen girls , who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a stair@@ way , a wall full of plates by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; disk art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my investigations yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not having st@@ rolling through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid star@@ ing out of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who dis@@ appears over the shoulders of nothing of the middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French court ref@@ uses provision on demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops , in which people are selling goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ beverages , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a fire and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups condemned the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the temporary shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and complimentary meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 Provisi@@ onal businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the &quot; &quot; pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais &quot; &quot; were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closing &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time , Rad@@ pro@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get under@@ scored . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; it is frank@@ ly difficult for me to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le had led .
&quot; at the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times .

click here for En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed@@ ometers : in various federal states , including H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash@@ guns are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ ers should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the Futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary Tem@@ pl@@ ets there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ itz for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for un@@ interrupted measurement operations , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all vehicles can be detected at the same time using laser measurement technology . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive pro@@ hibitions according to time , travel and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven condition , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer h@@ itch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; to ensure that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also slip resistant outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ender from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash@@ ing with the new technology : recently , France ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year . &quot;
great Britain pic@@ ks silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold brings
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back @-@ up , line @-@ up and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was defeated by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in top shape with this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former chief for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under Ry@@ an . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and allowed the GBS attacks to colli@@ de with fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell , and Co . , as if one would run into running buses . the World Series winners went to the top 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au rus@@ hed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ep@@ tive T@@ ackle by Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fi@@ ji has just stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua took a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ birth and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ i@@ ded by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB carried out basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua made Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favour of the South se@@ ein@@ tu@@ ans whose fans sang , flags bends and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame continued the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ ff sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB kick@@ ed anni@@ hil@@ ately beaten in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ fry team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing boat
there will be no more em@@ ote gold than with these games and that &apos;s what you want .
&quot; from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they ru@@ ined the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who put such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ 4 in@@ put@@ ted effort , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ l@@ ete who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of trium@@ ph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and no one was worse than the coach , who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that was the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ pac@@ ed morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was the cent@@ uri@@ on in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
&quot; over the past five years , Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race . &quot;
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were unable to keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let oneself be s@@ nat@@ ched .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something rab@@ bit .
&quot; we did not want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years provided exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the association counts as &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was said some time ago in the original one in a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ conia declared the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was employed for 31 years in the Emplo@@ yer &apos;s Association , stands for 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Dr@@ inking Water Association , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 15@@ 0000 m3 of water each year and supplies 32 locations and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
water supply contracts are available for other towns and communities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was appointed as a water attend@@ ant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water line construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , household planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and I have repeatedly added new features , because water is poll@@ uted and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association , and he lived quite well with the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Water Forum of Lower Fran@@ conia . &quot;
for this he received very much praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler praised the Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water attend@@ ant and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and re @-@ structuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the quar@@ ry at the high container at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; once again , the supply of Neu@@ brunn could only be maintained because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who follows Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler &apos;s successor . &quot;
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is openly dealing with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;

&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot;
&quot; but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well forward and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - a man sho@@ ots to life partner
&quot; on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man killed in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) to his partner and wounded her . &quot;
&quot; the man himself called upon us and stated to have shot his partner &apos;s partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly tra@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ burnt and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a plate . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun in himself , thus the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police spoke of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lübeck did not want to provide any information about the course or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but she confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; this is a delicate matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Flas@@ h@@ back for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; in the release from renewable energy conversion to the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said , &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday Edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that after two years we could finally achieve tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said to the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will be replaced . &quot;
but also this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel is future , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emission rights trade , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed more than the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China cast iron on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers are casting price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , import duties are shown on import st@@ alls , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened up . &quot;
unclear is how sustain@@ ably the price @-@ recovery is .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ rupp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have been rather stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp did not want to exclude entries from individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl took place on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short raise in May , the requested quantity went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , they do something good about their health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard Hac@@ kler of the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors are singing in the choir and sharing the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; thanks to regular meetings , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures are often dis@@ solving , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and to organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; because in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the pu@@ ddle , even in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der sen@@ iors @-@ Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening to songs in elderly people aw@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people are self @-@ contradic@@ tory in the long preceding events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrating on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people who live alone , practice so not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I am long for something , I will get better and more vig@@ il@@ ant beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate , even if he thinks little talent to have , advises L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears that when a sound goes next ? &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says Hac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many towns also offer views over the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with internet research . &quot;
&quot; those who want to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises Hac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the rep@@ lication of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equally in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al level of cat Bab@@ ies on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten per cent faster to Lau@@ te von Kitt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary University of Applied Sciences and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; journal . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens are different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a cri@@ es of babies , taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens that were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results concl@@ usive despite the low sample exam .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned out more quickly to the speaker when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males did react at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women responded more sensitive to inf@@ ants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski grab@@ s a cup with &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempt to overthrow it in July . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
this is not the case in front of football .
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ ett Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür , the Prosec@@ ution made an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the southern door living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ k@@ ür should be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who will be held accoun@@ table by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; although the initial state of emergency last for 90 days is still valid until October , but actually this has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places all over the country declared Erd@@ og@@ an to be finished on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in trailer and opponent &apos;s Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
&quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in the history of the Turks , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart is beating for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal &apos;s &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially reg@@ ained to Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , Cologne celebrated its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy of his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; say good @-@ b@@ ye in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it only reached sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we have done and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot;
&quot; for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year &apos;s year was better . &quot;
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seas@@ cap@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ remedi@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; the AC Florence , which was under contract at AC Florence , had announced only extra@@ ordinarily borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return to the country after the political situation in the country after his European vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storm would have to be ready to reno@@ unce around a third of its estimated 7.5 million Euro @-@ estimated millennium , Or@@ man stated : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence can &apos;t pay us . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has already been closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had filed their starting right just before the Games after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly fl@@ atten@@ ed out and un@@ tied at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizarre scene : with a super@@ posed smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering tower . &quot;
&quot; but there are numerous other athletes , who go to the start despite D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had already been closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month lock after having been detected by O@@ xy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the 2012 Olympic Champion was tested on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin in 2012 and European Championship from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the deliber@@ ate intake and was locked for six months .
the four wid@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big fav@@ ori@@ as .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and had been banned for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible and eu@@ than@@ ised Mer@@ ritt .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete had seen so many medals in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; in 2008 , the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was awarded back to CAS by a judge of the International Sports Tribunal . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world regi@@ sters and fav@@ ori@@ tin have only been tested positive in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references were found on taking a forbidden nutritional supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ A@@ DA dropped out and ran on July 13th . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian Viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already been able to leave this . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; once again two explosive devices went up again , and a further human being killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police indications . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a municipal employee . &quot;
Rau@@ e Firm of the Year for Information Technology
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast as well as in ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast demanded several injured . &quot;
&quot; one is going from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning from journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably it is the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognise a pattern in the proposals that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ istic uprising or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they have not been informed of the exact timing and locations . &quot;
&quot; it is still unclear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police told their officials all over the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the explo@@ itable bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary journeys into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were un@@ successful a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution executed by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this also grants great influence to the military in the coming years .
&quot; j@@ un@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country continues towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , has committed itself to having led the Kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel uprising of Muslim rebels for many years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
&quot; nearly one year ago , in Bangkok , when an attack was killed in a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is targeted at the Federal Office of constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; identified motion &apos; references for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional partner Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional ministers in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identified &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ eva said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Executive Vice President . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ aß said , &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ eva said he would not speak of new rights terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have established in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Group .
&quot; it may be quite possible that further ri@@ gh@@ tist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of legal terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ zo expressed that many off@@ enses went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right @-@ wing scene . &quot;
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated perpetr@@ ators or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have elected CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alized the right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; not always , Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics . &quot;
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ ash during the summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slowly that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ its subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his trial with a back of 48 seconds and occupied the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
&quot; since in Ethiopia most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
&quot; some media described him as &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; ben@@ evol@@ ent b@@ ump &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ est@@ yle , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also bred .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention . &quot;
&quot; an unforgettable one was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in an advance over 100 meters of free @-@ style alone . &quot;
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
&quot; in an accident of a touring coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , granted the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their specifications , had to avoid an accommo@@ dating truck that partly rode on the opposite track . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the state road 2 .

there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the load experienced and possible witnesses to contact the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter wast@@ ewater amount to the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ esi@@ ze 3,@@ 44 sewage plant from 1 October 2016 ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ ure 3,@@ 64 Euro ( until now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the sewage charges will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a high @-@ rate calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 Euro per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was approved by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach County Council , for these wast@@ ewater treatment plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ covering . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Administr@@ ative Manager , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a new calculation of fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , sur@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the previous calculation period can be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the engraving rate increases for all three se@@ wer@@ age systems with relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ewater treatment , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , waste water in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age of rehabilitation and repair costs , rehabilitation and repair costs have been considerable . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for the Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a pollut@@ ant in the Az@@ ure sewage plant .
&quot; in the pum@@ ping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old convey@@ ors had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason . after nearly 20 years , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system could be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that during the low wast@@ ewater treatment in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully exploited .
&quot; in the process , Schmidt continued to have spar@@ ed the market community of great entertainment costs in the wast@@ ewater facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious as one cannot expand the sewage @-@ purpose association Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal in order not to expand these facilities because these facilities are defic@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % have been booked .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in pre @-@ month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as a Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; snapshot says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already del@@ im@@ ited to the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are uns@@ us@@ el@@ ded , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have critici@@ zed criticism in which they were accused of promoting the App Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some revi@@ e@@ wers called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; Yellow Face &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of vulnerable cli@@ ch@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and in@@ convenient . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not safe , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the opposite extreme . &quot;
snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural trip wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who in matters of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters create an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a head@@ set for medium and in a phone interview , she said she believes that racial controversy is a lack of diversity in the setting practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the largely white , only male leadership , and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the snapshot has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently hired a staff responsible , focusing on sub @-@ represented populations and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that she will let her Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership mis@@ ses IS@@ IS intelligence intelligence , provides Committee of the Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command introduced intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the armed force committee , intelligence committees and military budget committee reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services , typically charged by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly reported a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , a Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Refer@@ ences , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; the report stated . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force into life after listening to them that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations in the Cent@@ com report are ongoing by the General Insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can task force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; said the supreme democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; in@@ stituted the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no indication of any intervention of the White House at Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general insp@@ ector , who received complaints from Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , announced in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congress , while investigations of the general insp@@ ector would still be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important topics of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have further re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Islamic State reminds of the feu@@ ds of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , saw a written piece about how the then government conducted under George W. Bush in contrast to the recommendations of many analysts and gave little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker confirms that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , the government did not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ re@@ &apos;s dam@@ s commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States gains fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain is before &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not part of the people who keep their doors alive .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; the first placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch , who lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game ends on Saturday , the Americans have spark@@ ed a start@@ ling whir@@ l@@ wind through their success story , four years after they were landing at the last London Games in the last of 12 squares . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work@@ load in London , which we now have . &quot;
we have completely torn the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gates in the first half of the game with a bac@@ kl@@ ash from the near area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without winning the tournament , but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and l@@ up@@ ed the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous matches . &quot;
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and un@@ avo@@ idable , a rapid relay between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is handed over by the w@@ rist@@ band to float to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the coff@@ e@@ eshop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could have been under these known names to be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , in part in the shadow are the sports which are not commonly recognized : air@@ guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the ni@@ p@@ ples and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived so spar@@ sely the last 16 years that many people , I had questioned , did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who want to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bear@@ ded enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ary trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , the two sports which essentially unite . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ erc@@ ing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ ons must go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ or@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the goal oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel at watching these games as a little ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she bo@@ unces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be reached through the spru@@ e and the objective of male athletes - as the male US @-@ gymn@@ asts recently hit the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ se , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are breaking on the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that sixty prot@@ esters were killed during colli@@ sions with the police during shot changes .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people burst into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s answer was un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot;
witnesses stated that police officers shot and killed on ump@@ teen non @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people sm@@ ash young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to dominate the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or to jail , killed or driven into the vast expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the governing coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions are rising along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less in recent years , utilize the turbul@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ ouse themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of self @-@ indul@@ gence under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians declared that they were so prot@@ esting against them .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly come from Christian countries , in politics and economy while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is changing just too .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; said MUL@@ AT@@ U Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in an un@@ published disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in taking early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to edit enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ scrut@@ able reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands against elections , which , according to the analysts , apparently fu@@ elled from the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal suspic@@ ion of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a sham@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray , attacked businesses and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray became more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights across the neighbouring Somalia , even if it recently concluded that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin tigh@@ tro@@ pe walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his statement Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings about his comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of declar@@ ing statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp imp@@ eded regarding the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the alleg@@ ation perfectly serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wished to weak@@ en the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism hit Mr. Tru@@ mp as he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would give suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech d@@ ull . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already put sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I said that sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the language limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans , how they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ agu@@ ely enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp assumed an even more estimated tone , because his demand values continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday revealed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general attempts to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often accused his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he emphas@@ ises in the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent care@@ gi@@ vers , gave great effort to defend candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was questioned about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense it is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called it rear @-@ bro@@ kers , completely false , and therefore it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Republi@@ cans argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot ! . &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s dism@@ iss@@ al than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
&quot; once the price of the market is displaced by the market , it comes back to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a coff@@ in cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years , good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which was replaced by Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people felt it as the last loss in a city that was g@@ entri@@ fying .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ella wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , it is also new finding . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept many things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same bul@@ bs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ dening agents like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é oni@@ ons .
there are rice dishes .
&quot; the café serves no beer any more , there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed aside from Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the camp regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she gave a while to drink coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual ced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarters to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ b@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment , and add new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap shop took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of cafés as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new client transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has planned to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coff@@ ees like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt accepted his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ proof soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on that day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; tra@@ ded Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small snack bar at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sand@@ wich with olive pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter depos@@ ited Hack@@ br@@ aten , this found the couple for a discussion about food in the Er@@ a of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut , liver and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that el@@ ong@@ ated the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ anu@@ ts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male Fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; shows the ways in which the country was surrounded , no longer be the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; Co@@ e told why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole recovered as a &quot; wonderful species , food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noticed that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ tious ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of the American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures were tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onion with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever , fiscal econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were the eating habits of the country in such a way . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household police &quot; &quot; and the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e such cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake food attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the million @-@ million man from the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was terri@@ fic to reality .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would not have called him an ex@@ hor@@ tation with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hi@@ ring of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosev@@ elt led to the fact that the White House brought out the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the Er@@ a of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of the G@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law in the book of the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they pulled out a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roosev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick , humble recipes a fancy name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on into the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it did not taste bad .
CO@@ E took three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bomb attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers set their own life in the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses , and to make their first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard , showing him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , he said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me , this is the true ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrels over the river of Alz@@ adia , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Grön@@ land shar@@ k : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ y usually only comes to the surface in winter .
&quot; after an examination on board the ship S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Grön@@ land ha@@ y will only get young people with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely swi@@ ms the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches just 1.@@ 220 metres in average . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates on sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this way of slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; at any rate from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution bi@@ ologist pres@@ umes for a long time , Greenland ha@@ y is st@@ ony . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ y is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the Greenland @-@ ha@@ y lifestyle .
&quot; their time l@@ up@@ unc@@ ed them , as they made six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
perhaps they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ tures from higher water layers down .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the nucle@@ us of the shar@@ k using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
&quot; therefore , after the early 1960s , their birth should be reduced to the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon search for larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons in which 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters in length contain a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons . it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ y , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lin@@ eage , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Grön@@ land shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters would be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Grön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ timet@@ res probably stood at the threshold for sexually mature and his age was determined at 156 years , Greenland ha@@ y obviously has at least one and a half centuries time . &quot;
also this should be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ ane problems live mainly in icy waters is no accident .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 year old har@@ poon pointed , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often exp@@ ires on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal leaves heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life . &quot;
building plot in a double pack
&quot; with topics related to building construction , the council in the most recent meeting has focuss@@ ed on the most important aspects . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the board accepted the notification of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ li@@ ement and development questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on survey , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ er weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) to interested parties is no longer in the way . &quot;
the municipality is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and ru@@ th@@ less senior citizens alike .
&quot; as it was said , people can immediately report to the town hall , about the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els , the municipal council is expected to consult in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to respond to requests concerning settlement of further commercial establishments , linked to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of Lower @-@ time , the industrial area has already been extended by two plots towards the state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chances to move from London reloc@@ ated jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Competence Network Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks continue to operate from London in financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been given approval in the UK so far . &quot;
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important agencies such as the European Insurance Pro@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and ES@@ R@@ B &apos;s risk record . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg supplies a large fund industry , it cuts down badly at the same time as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has an easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultants Merc@@ er , the city is on place 7 , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at the 34@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if a quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W then concludes . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; in the end of 2015 , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ dt in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead ob@@ tains legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. official ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc claimed to reimbur@@ se the legal costs you incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead stood , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ er@@ ea and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. officer Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck accused each other and claimed property on laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the blood of Gilead . &quot;
the US supported troops say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; by the US forces supported the complete control over the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j close to the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokes@@ man on Friday said . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , according to the extract of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , shared Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council affiliated with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently running &quot; &quot; clearing up &quot; , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
clinics deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a revenue of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.@@ 3 million in speech hon@@ or@@ ations ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million for her book about her ten@@ ure in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton publish his tax declarations for the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim K@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ush opposition , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ters regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; says Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the audi@@ ts are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Cri@@ tics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding property , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his deal@@ ings and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ cans Tru@@ mp are calling for his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke on the subject also during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp paid no or very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure that individuals paying more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has its seat here , Tru@@ mp becomes a meeting to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; he said that he was also subjected to a tax audit conducted by the I@@ RS , and Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were referred to as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons paid divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with chim@@ ney , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ phant &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to stop eleph@@ ants from inhab@@ iting people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea many years ago , has intensified their promotion along with U.S. natural protection by using volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , using a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvesting without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is a World Call Day devoted to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without hur@@ ting the elephant in doing so , &quot; said the CEO of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ants of the elephant with a torch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chil@@ lies &quot; &quot; is cast . &quot;

a touch is usually already out to hunt the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er that sho@@ ots a fire@@ power plant in the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director sh@@ attered Berlin hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election , as Arab guests had requested an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; the country was not listed among the countries , which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
&quot; the reason behind it , broke even more fur@@ y in the director . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response on the internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab score &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed of it , it was stated in another article in which it was noted that the hotel , located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dism@@ issed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; not to include Israel in the Quick Selec@@ tor list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police puts tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they assembled to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties started when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits spra@@ ying on walls against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after prot@@ esters in crowds went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed from the office by a vote of the Senate on their dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian businesses grew strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade up@@ swing was achieved by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan continues this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian representation of about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , delivered to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries affecting the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

Nag@@ old : fun game and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social educational day group / social group work of the Nag@@ old child protection association with their supervis@@ ors during their summer vacation in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet hamlet of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
for one thing we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
&quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guided tour in the world @-@ famous clo@@ ister . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the seaf@@ ar@@ ers unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next round trip of all ministers in two years , the Federal Minister of Education of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgrimage destinations were checked and one finally decided to visit the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage goal was offered at the Freiburg Min@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Fr . Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m crosses and par@@ ted the Pil@@ gri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster young loved woman is standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage moved from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is of field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made a rest to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and powerful dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , the stage was taken to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but in the heat of the heat the heat had to be lowered about 500 metres and then climbed again . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue on the beach at the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter , we went to the closing stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the min@@ is arrived in the late afternoon at Freiburg Min@@ ster and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was given thanks . &quot;

&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the metropolis of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite Gold wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the Men &apos;s Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . the J@@ UNG@@ and made the legend proudly when he rus@@ hed home to visit a victory from the favorites of New Zealand .
&quot; four years ago England claimed a shock@@ ing victory , while Ho@@ y clin@@ ched the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after returning in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the withdrawal Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in good time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Schot@@ ten , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner made an olymp@@ ic record in the qualification rounds , but in the stand@@ ings the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ ds came back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear to slow it down and to allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell down Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we placed an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and the world champion defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys site , Hin@@ di admitted that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally dropped onto the track . &quot;
he drew this statement back later and there was no appeal against England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an over@@ looked victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team during the last three months .
with so many world titles we got so badly that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the de@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal . &quot;
that &apos;s the case of Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; the World Record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; he had argued yesterday with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue and end tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team is rel@@ ying on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a ch@@ ar of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , drama did not play in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and b@@ ob@@ bling alleg@@ ations , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite later than could be the legendary reputation that has reached its culmin@@ ation at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to cancellation of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts , as the supplied energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect , could be at risk at a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ oes , as the melting shop consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation Vic@@ tori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses some money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting shop , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; securing business &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already cancelled the value of the contracts in its annual drop of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to exp@@ el the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the supply of power to the melt &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Mel@@ ting Port in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analysts at the start of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity each year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to we@@ eping , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover was a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , scann@@ ed reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s favorite show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . they all have a surprise party planned . &quot;
&quot; this poses the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action nearly every birthday sep@@ tum of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; Kim &apos;s great sister Kim likes it , as for the vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most widely @-@ selling edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which is more like a picture book than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were adverti@@ sed by the 8@@ 32 pages of the author &apos;s 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still perme@@ ated before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small probability that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people , or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if it applies to Jen@@ ner ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who excel in the entertainment sector .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; The Mist@@ resses of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings showed up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ carriage , the point seems to pass by . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is shown in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centres reject 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid figures are reported annually by the municipal utilities industry , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further central reductions on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ usions and similar - have been rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already obsol@@ ete , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
the director of Que@@ esland James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Union of Commun@@ ism Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dism@@ issed each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without a repe@@ al of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ lands communities are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning thousands of people from important services you need to be dism@@ issed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and repres@@ sive debts , families who were dism@@ issed by divisions , workers who were wron@@ g@@ ly dism@@ issed - all these people have problems legal and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the federal government will shor@@ ten the means by 30 per cent , which means thousands of people in Que@@ ens@@ land need to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosec@@ utor and Federal Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for right @-@ wing hel@@ pers on the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the commun@@ es and their customer communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign indic@@ ted after employee report@@ edly moved weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had put a fire@@ arm on a staff , while they were in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte County Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have been waiting for months , that the matter would be regulated internally before it realised that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the de@@ duction and grab@@ bed the barrel in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compl@@ aining about the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation only comes after two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate has triggered a uph@@ eav@@ al , when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment people - fire@@ arms owners and arms friends - should take action if his ri@@ val H@@ illary Clinton can be elected and judge judges . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly indicated that the media would have ri@@ pped his words from the context and that he would not drive to violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint requires damages of the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence and of Philip on account of bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s press spokes@@ man Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls by his consulting company , Innovative consulting services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l against Länder elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties . &quot;
&quot; these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute In@@ sa for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible according to the demand values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD is the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to position the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD of 35.@@ 6 percent fell to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the followers now dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes at the beginning , which would now range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; &quot; Office in the West pocket format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has been different . &quot;
the smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was finally sold and wound to Microsoft .
today &apos;s vendors dominate the market all much later than Nokia .
&quot; being online anywhere and anytime , this is everyday for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , were sold by 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around € 400 billion .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telec@@ om provider . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone has developed an entire industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on Mac @-@ World . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had the night vision . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
&quot; today , every Deutsche now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to use the smartphone even once , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Management Board for staff . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , it represented the biggest attraction he@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics drew a great advantage for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; we will alone offer 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips for our local communities , creating 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion he@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ ink on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question asked question . &quot;
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in corporate growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ play &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising revenue , according to one of the software vendors attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; scratch and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it claimed that users could update their filters in the program to re@@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change encoding for its adver@@ ts to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the site advertising is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that there was a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the Spe@@ aker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of ho@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o battle between the time @-@ all@@ uring open source community and the Um@@ mm@@ ers has already been in progress since the invention of display blo@@ cker , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator blo@@ ggers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , we use around 200 million people ad blo@@ cker ; almost four times so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users , who access Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung is making 84 percent of the advertising revenue of Facebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has said it to ad blo@@ cker on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks of mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a huge amount of revenue , so Facebook sees the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; to give people more control of their commerci@@ alised advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks were new filters wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; a Facebook user shared in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we instead focus on Develop@@ ers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control over people &apos;s hands . &quot;
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred to a presum@@ ed suicide by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman set off in the Dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , which was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a colli@@ sion avo@@ idable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases , in which one person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian walk@@ eth in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted when she had beaten and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 on the A1 , near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious of the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus probably was once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could once have revealed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turning of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere , and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical variation to shelter life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow movement of Venus is exposed to its tag@@ ging of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by planetary research .
&quot; although she was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years - was exposed to excessive heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans were evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen@@ esis , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide eman@@ ated with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , the way we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy stepping back as trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy represented on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations from the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a slight co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the colour ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy won the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams awards as the best coach of the league during his debut season .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two songs with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; North @-@ e@@ ye@@ es resume talks again , set off strike &quot;
&quot; the fight against wages for North sea workers will be exposed , while all the armed parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea running through Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ define the resolution process of the present dispute , &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start next year in order to tackle the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rating is based on a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company have the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; because of the lower prices of cru@@ de oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates , among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rot@@ ates in star loops to different rates and in which connection the rot@@ ational periods with the planet origin are standing .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star loops , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 years of light from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star , which originated about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning to the quick@@ est .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars are reaching large amounts of star win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by det@@ ecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest production of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars turn more slowly than less solid stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower tracks than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us what we want to know more about how , When and Why stars can slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star emerges
tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; goodbye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has earned him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members , H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - on the field was so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; gave a ban on ster@@ o@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to the involvement in the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to have been a major suspect for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends even get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a goodbye tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win every game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and said to the relationships with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy for the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio must not start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a learned ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese Schwi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions this news at the time . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court in CAS rati@@ fied its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the proceedings over 50 m of freedom . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court of CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news oo@@ zes the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the forbidden substance is to act around the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended in advance , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported immediately to criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions . &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians standing under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was announced , the London Olympics Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier , on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both do not deny intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had banned the entire Russian team except for systematic den@@ op@@ ying , including Kenya &apos;s runner nation producing numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in swimming sport , the previous deaths in China had also taken care of fierce battles between athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the chin@@ ese Olympic champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ est@@ yle , I want to hand over me , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data @-@ ke@@ epers : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail utilities currently target companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the Lö@@ se@@ gel@@ ders demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , speci@@ alize in attacks in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the col@@ oring programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an opt @-@ off , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as to archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stopped . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage is higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware is canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German firms involved reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ time in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they tell their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to bar@@ gain partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , explained safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kit was created by purchasing the malware by yourself , coun@@ seling and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the hei@@ rs are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instru@@ cts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is done per infected host .
&quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
over 50 percent of the company &apos;s IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to rep@@ ay Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful execution , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could have completely new goals on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermo@@ stat linked to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have plenty of room in the first row as well as in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work closely at any location . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit top is slightly different . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l with raised back@@ rests and 10@@ 26 l for back@@ flip back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the benches of the rear bench can be folded up like chin @-@ chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ l @-@ diesel tested with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V due to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should slightly pret@@ end his work somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment does not leave anything to be desired in the top @-@ version &quot; Executive &quot; version .
&quot; to the security systems , the City @-@ emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because of the manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the smart tem@@ per re@@ acts to the recognition of traffic signs and th@@ rot@@ tles if necessary the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are al@@ right .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ to @-@ day car . &quot;
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of danger that is typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a cra@@ b during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease : when paid the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a negotiated case , a family was seriously ill in diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step . &quot;
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective treatment plant , supposedly contaminated by sea@@ water . &quot;
the family was the opinion that the journey had been defic@@ i@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the purification plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er was informed only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
&quot; he did not hurt his information duties , so the verdict . &quot;
&quot; especially in the samples of the water , no im@@ puri@@ ties were found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by stak@@ ing among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; said Ms Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further attacks . &quot;
&quot; the state must be pru@@ dent , and at the same time resol@@ utely responding to terrorist attacks . &quot;
certainly : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and separation .
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , but the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the election of the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in mean four @-@ digit magnitude over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be punished . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance aims to improve the tru@@ ce of arms , especially when purchasing weapons on the Internet . &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be preserved according to the Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the danger of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a look about psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers necessary social support necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be prepared to deal with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminal criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior is clearly opposed to Action . &quot;
&quot; this was an ear cow@@ ard for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of double nationality before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a general ban on full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional law . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
one can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green CEO Simone Peter accused the minister who would like to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror acts of action and ability to act .
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet inspections and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people no more safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway exit
it st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the rule of law shall be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive via the motorway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the following Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction sector will be extended by 700 metres ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
drivers can then drive directly from Hammer Straße to the right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic is divided at an early stage , which improves the overall survival rate on the busy section of the road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the train nar@@ rowing at Zu@@ b@@ inger anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 hrs .
&quot; on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h trail and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only left lane through the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back three @-@ four@@ ths ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required load capacity , in order to absorb heavy load traffic in particular . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the work @-@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent state operation cannot be said . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal agreement , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities it may be expected . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday , traffic will be tra@@ cked on one lane at the construction site . &quot;
intercultural Travel : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes as part of this project in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most youth in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Mu@@ en@@ ster and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , the press release of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background from 14 to 20 years will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language teaching are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement in weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night for Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain , to observe the heavenly spectac@@ les , said the Chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many con@@ stell@@ ations in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stell@@ ations are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations per hour with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , one rolls around for hours . at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think about sleep long before w@@ aking . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces express ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board member of the German Society for Sle@@ ep Research and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one sees in the meantime is , however , the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an in@@ let and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; just sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German household medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind this , organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can also be used as medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is particularly common in case of depression , &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors determine each other .
&quot; for example , who has a band failure , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to sal@@ ute over everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and com@@ promised the day should go to the doctor , advises we@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary Dor@@ ental Medical Center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , is hardly available in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , advises we@@ eds . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; for an examination in the sleep laboratory medicine , for example , in snor@@ ing with breath @-@ taking , in case of sickness , in sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make lunch hi@@ ber@@ nation , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the cab@@ ling , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ ends on the ceiling . &quot;
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of de@@ cks where you can sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ aving count on : regular sleep and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first picked up gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ track World Championships in Doh@@ a and simultaneously presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has provided protection against his ex @-@ team colleagues in front of his criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € award and a jungle King 150,000 € nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in swimming sports is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; those who do not have a certain time before WM / OS of independent Controll@@ ers of the W@@ A@@ DA / FIN@@ A may not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ bur@@ gers who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de packed by luggage lock@@ ers
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civil investig@@ ators of the Düsseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ bags and luggage theft .
&quot; at 9 : 30 , civil servants recognized in the area of Düsseldorf Airport a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen of past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were common , working @-@ wise and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime series 34 can demonstrate four acts of th@@ iev@@ es , which had been entered specifically for the operation of criminal off@@ ences to Germany . &quot;
&quot; they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a remnant of cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like that , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , you come to play@@ grounds , a refres@@ hed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
someone has &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; on the facade of a grey house !
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , is already being built : a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; as mentioned in the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in , however , are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has spoken out several times for a hard police action against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after leaving the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers pulled out under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain before late Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main source of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * who runs three children here are gener@@ v@@ t mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and g@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; who wants to make a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent left . &quot;
the dig@@ ging of the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between home@@ owners and their neighbours does not exist .
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also today compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street near Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under great police custody in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized at Riga and are partly inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : with them , residents from GDR times and former home occup@@ iers are now sharing their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; many of the new@@ buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been dis@@ car@@ ded with color @-@ bags . &quot;
no other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words &quot; Left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes charges obj@@ ection@@ able damage , which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ement house near the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is wei@@ ght@@ lifting : people in the 94 are their neighbors who are certainly not . &quot;
&quot; even the famous burning cars , there is no longer any longer in Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has consciously moved into the streets of Riga - and stayed .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents got back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are actually con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot;
but what should we do if someone has never listened to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ iled , who are angry about colour bombs : the Hau@@ g Projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who runs , should be aware of it - just like someone who is moving into a pub area that can badly complain about noise . &quot;
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name .
&quot; Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le , new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es &quot;
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the spokes@@ person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pe@@ dago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the hus@@ band@@ ment of Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ owa , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; as a result , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing than much on the multitude of tasks required - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative authority with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , was also sought after . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le honored and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the annex@@ ation .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the land council office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t work until now , so you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be er@@ ased as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be set up in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments is it not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or helping house@@ work , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are ra@@ r .
&quot; so , here are administration and volunteers . &quot;
&quot; it is central , that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever evol@@ ves the feeling , he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also problems , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this was a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two most recent events fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine says quite clearly &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; . &quot; a residual risk cannot and would not exclude them . &quot;
the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents were also the topic of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins put them completely on their call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
&quot; they have always in the background , that soon a new push for refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach could come . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher , too , have already been utili@@ sed to integrate the previous people reasonably . &quot;
&quot; currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : intru@@ der with helicopter needed
the police helicopter flew over for about an hour different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men forced forci@@ bly into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning .
the people surprised both of them and struck the dis@@ b@@ anding into the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters in size , probably mas@@ king , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies were wearing . &quot;
they fled toward the city centre .
&quot; for the prosecution , the police put a number of strikes and a police helicopter . &quot;
the ma@@ dness ran out without success .
&quot; in any case , the unknown were in fact close to the apartment or in their flight . &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police search for ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
