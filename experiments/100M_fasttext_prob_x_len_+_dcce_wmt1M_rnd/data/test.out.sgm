<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little diversion with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses reminded me of their holiday, they hunted at the fast gallop home to the forage troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at that speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the equestrian career ended up again."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he was able to lead his family over the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not hesitate for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid ranged the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the golden pyramid of sport.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen liked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young people for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-times US master winner was added to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes are Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fenders Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping-runner Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza-Price ran."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump would rather remain small and cautious about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively revert regulations, and he is fighting for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, there could be no party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-operate the coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand renewables with its investment programme:" a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the trance trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, they don't want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they are to be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rust, then he says he cannot be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics argue, that the budget deficit would only be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women who flee alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby that is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious in the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a responsible for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the theme of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for single-wing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs joined the organisation together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experience on her escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten them torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope-bearers."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there are other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they come into Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abusive."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying that they have nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not want to help, there is more accommodation for them only for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven district governments in Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabians, only escaped women are not accommodated isolated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are some common stories of stories or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separate from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are harmed separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, it can lead to - persistent - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washing rooms should be separated and readily accessible to women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much women feel this need of protection, one can read at the rush, which there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since he has spoken about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors called their union to approve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work measures in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that it had been meeting ministers to address the concerns about the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, Assistance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in favor of the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and announce an official end of the eight-month long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated ballroom of St. Petersburg's palace, I cannot deny that Ankara would most like this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin smiled smiles and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved like that would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory words: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"to rebuild the vetoire becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the allegations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received Erdogan's apologies he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he was given the last month in a failed coup d'etat almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are picked up again."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-colonial assault on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry with the West, as the reaction to the attempted power of power was regarded as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued grudge over the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara with security, the Russian state of states won a bonus for him that he demanded support for the selected state organs after the attempted coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to show how an analyst was once described as an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that have driven away from the west and treated badly and now allied themselves."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents announced at the press conference that they wouldn't even have striped the topic."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided reply to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan granted the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Bank has since dissociated since then, when it had to be almost collapsed and saved almost eight years ago."</seg>

<seg id="7">"she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray."</seg>

<seg id="9">"the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized."</seg>

<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">"he said to the BBC Scotland:" "the RSB brand will become our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy, as we are now becoming a bank of brands."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local targets."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue to sponsor the Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in his sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands, for how do we focus internally (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" "said the Chairman of the Management Board."</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who had been deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it means (in Russian) that he later was the chief of the clerk and staff of the Government staff."</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin about his appointment:" "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state with respect to draft bills and controls for the implementation of your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday, that Ivanov asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor."</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuade the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has mysteriously swept Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin and worked as he worked for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "it's true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to entrust post four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office would have violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, closest ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the $1,35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017"</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North-deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower", "which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Crossings Queensferry crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total amount of bridge is in their place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete base in Rosyth today for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first shutter is a significant milestone in each bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the shutter represents forward-looking high-tech and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the North turmdeck in the extension, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or south side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive because the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards by about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"the SPD and the Greens said: in future, investors should be taken into duty much more in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years? "</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "Action Concept" "for the next council session."</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A scheme is missing up to now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, will have to exhibit 20 percent of all homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also arise in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great dispute in the town hall is, however, said Bratmann:" how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing construction program that will cost millions of dollars and still has to be financed should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, said Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, so Bratmann, making a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the programme is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of further 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one blow the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the western city run for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social dwellings in the western city is increased drastically again, one can be removed from the aim of so-called mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social-weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said Group president Holger Herlitschke:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"indeed, I have concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes."</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a teenager and child no longer want to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, many have been complaining about many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were created for video games in the 1990ies (later arose a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the turkey and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game resulted in a significant increase in steps that the" average "person refuses every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who followed 35.000 users recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to" "take 30 minutes" "to be" "coming from the sofa" "and" "every day" "sticking on deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people who are elappointing."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also maces that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they didn't give us reason to do sports as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be reduced with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the Active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first bloody attack of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fired weapon, while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, is read in the report."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered."</seg>

<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>

<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chair of the BMA Committee for Assistance, shared the last night in a communication with:" "assistance doctors have made serious concerns about the proposed deal, especially that it will heighten the current staff crisis and meeting it to treat all physicians appropriately."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness evokes election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored as a discontinued government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former Cabinet of Cabinet Sir Eric Pickles, verbally attacks the police, obstructed observers and the general councils to ignore the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of" intolerance regarding ethnicities and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now a corrupted king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabins in order to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have an ID with themselves, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"currently, a voter must only name its name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report suggests to apply non-removable inks to the finger of a person, when they give up their votes to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It requires that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves against electoral fraud, but should also protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes along with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets franchise in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be given to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way, and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" his campaign on the ground, that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation, in which one person chooses another person."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent letter of letters - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding out ways to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it is said:" "evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or bangladjan background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... governmental institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour based on "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists manipulate letter selection documents to stop" "reap". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, taken into consideration by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral system being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Non removable ink on the finger of a person use as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible to participate.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic postal code.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists edit complete letter-elections and envelopes from wallets.</seg>
<seg id="29">Police force the authority to set up gates for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in legislation that facilitates an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Public Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photo ban in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Request that only English can be used in the polls (except for Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the staff rule the rule that voters go alone in the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlets case no penalty was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court lent Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty according to the high demands of criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "checkups" "of the election registries of the Town Hall."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"as the mother of the parliaments, our country carries a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden proliferation of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when you approach you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and go out of the line," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then strike it with the knee in the bar and twist it while the attacker complains of pain, the gun out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as they set up the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worseness of a serious test by distracting some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk threw his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a purse button of a pull-on toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the corners of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to us what he is getting involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to detract the rinsing button of a pull toilette that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he distracted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to rinse knobs of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely under one sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was just in line with his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample show showed a luminometer count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, the luminometer value is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after their luminaires were more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," That comes the worst thing that I have smelled in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm not going to lick anything here, because it is disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried crazy brainstorming which ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing the film, added:" let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had spotted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the ekelly Russian toilet shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to punish them and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these filthy leaks on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents were associated with lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and the intestines and 58 percent said they would at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive crying, stripping and flukes."</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wood floors were ripped up."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing dismissed her and her partner forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the delogiation was acclaimed by lightened neighbors, saying that their life was made to hell."</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They killed nobody." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family agreed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the church building, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as a delogizing is always the last step taken into consideration Cornwall housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the church who have been courageous on us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will donate comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delozing on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">"workers of the house administration will now have to put garbage inn, which surround the house"</seg>

<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family knew her family about her death in Raqqa, Syria several weeks ago."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other girls from east London entered a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS militant in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow.</seg>

<seg id="6">"at short notice I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protectors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the President of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>

<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further repressed in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="12">"in doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining curds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"until 2021, the parliamentary elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for stupid as far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land-election campaigns - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the tourists travelling in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems arise: in the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflate air balloons, flyers, and end voices in the end, only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave the election campaign shortly before the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, Leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the countryside, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as it already did his legendary German predecessor, Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel has the blame on the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" We create that "accelerates the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the good office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its Spitzenkandidaten, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited chancellor Angela Merkel on major manifestations; Merkel's German district is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other German states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it is a pity not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel."</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, so, says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country you need to take the base away, that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the sides of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU electoral campaign cocooperates on his comrades, however, is also self-revealing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely, where people are: Dorfieste, Golden Weddings, each birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is on stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to an especially dedicated election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just scarcely before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the country day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and put their ballot into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the President of the state, Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green electoral combatants embark on search for local vocal folds among the holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the Spitzenkandidatin, curvt just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30 in the morning and finish only at 20 o'clock, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to relocate to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the award will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up makeshift entrances."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted, and with it the connection to Rottenburg is again made, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofandingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The transit traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were sometimes considerable complaints," says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the transport-related management of the reorganization. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many casualties were seeking and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were fraying in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality demanded more reinforcement of the measurement vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant transgressions," "says King, who made himself informed of the situation."</seg>
<seg id="17">There have already been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the road with 77 km kilometres in the pace-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved further, however, it has become quieter."</seg>

<seg id="21">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27 reorganization has led to revenue outbreaks, each one you ask is scrutinized."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for those who have less to do with the" "end customer", "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "slight decline", "but also admits that" "the caterer is missing". ""</seg>

<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to dismiss him.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint: otherwise, the restaurant benefitted from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, it also has to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER knows from other counties, where such a kind of funding has been handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all the complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars look less frequently now because of the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot drive, it is also somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the fact that his trunk-climbers return back to the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about that."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged dear plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to comment arrow to sow it under the pseudonym non-Allegra men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but is due to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older records keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a humble grey suit and gracious before I stop, hold my hands and say something more determining as:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings in which once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic panel specialisations."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to gauge their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men of middle age) ins Reckless Records (data count: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I'm selling are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, in which I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets to apply to YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media body, people who have heard about the comeback and have led to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the talks I have led, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the plate revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that plate business offers a soothing fellowship of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took off in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans of record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, of objects, the happy youth-innings waking up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to mentally deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "instilling a staff from a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player, whom they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while I was bleming through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle age) has noticed a" "trophy" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came here and said," "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound board so that I can put them into a shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-like."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who are only slowly coming."</seg>
<seg id="44">"fopp, which has dedicated the sound board almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women middle-aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizer- and sextet Pop instead of experimental jazz yokes from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but naïve psychic traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more of a shop window than buying a big shopping basket.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of board lovers: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to dress the jeans underpants, I watch a group of young teen girls, who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a stairway, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "disk art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my investigations yielded that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not having strolling through records of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid staring out of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who disappears over the shoulders of nothing of the middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops, in which people are selling goods, from cigarettes to energybeverages, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a fire and sanitation risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups condemned the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in addition, the temporary shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and complimentary meals for people in need."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 Provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the" "prefecture of Calais" "were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closing" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they ruined the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who put such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.4 inputted effort, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athlete who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that makes the difference and no one was worse than the coach, who did not know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that was the right term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-paced morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears."</seg>

<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">"over the past five years, Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race."</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were unable to keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, panning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="31">It is really important to not let oneself be snatched.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something rabbit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we did not want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Flashback for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the release from renewable energy conversion to the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said," "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "(WAZ, Friday Edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that after two years we could finally achieve tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said to the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent will be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" Steel is future, "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of the emission rights trade, climate and employment targets are to be weighed down," "said IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation worsened more than the world's largest producer of producer China cast iron on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are casting price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties are shown on import stalls, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainably the price-recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have been rather stagnating."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude entries from individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl took place on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short raise in May, the requested quantity went back to the second month in a row."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, they do something good about their health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors are singing in the choir and sharing the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"thanks to regular meetings, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures are often dissolving, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and to organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the puddle, even in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der seniors-Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz is often observed that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awakes many memories, often associated with positive emotions of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people are self-contradictory in the long preceding events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people who live alone, practice so not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I am long for something, I will get better and more vigilant beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate, even if he thinks little talent to have, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears that when a sound goes next?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"if you are looking for a suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer views over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"those who want to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="9">"once again two explosive devices went up again, and a further human being killed according to the authorities."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks bear the same signature," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning from journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but probably it is the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Also Thai media wanted to recognise a pattern in the proposals that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamistic uprising or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have received secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they have not been informed of the exact timing and locations."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is still unclear, which group behind the attacks."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police told their officials all over the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"following the exploitable bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary journeys into these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were unsuccessful a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution executed by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also grants great influence to the military in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country continues towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, has committed itself to having led the Kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel uprising of Muslim rebels for many years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed."</seg>
<seg id="38">"nearly one year ago, in Bangkok, when an attack was killed in a popular Hindu shrine, 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="7">"it turns against" "Multiculti-Wahn," "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of one's own identity through estrangement." "</seg>
<seg id="8">"constitutional ministers in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the" identified "already."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maeva said, his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the" Identity Movement "attempt to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Executive Vice President. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"in general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The faculties of Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a concrete advertising for one's own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maaß said," "I have no knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for constitutional protection, possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain persons, who are extremist, changes their direction and becomes so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maeva said he would not speak of new rights terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have established in recent years that there can be rightist structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may be quite possible that further rightist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a nationwide or pan-European control of legal terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"at the same time, Mazo expressed that many offenses went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right-wing scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects in attacks on asylum seekers were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated perpetrators or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who were perhaps politically indifferent, or have elected CDU, SPD or left, which, however, have radicalized the right-wing extremism."</seg>

<seg id="10">"the news and the outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="2">"military members of the United States Central Command introduced intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the armed force committee, intelligence committees and military budget committee reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence services, typically charged by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly reported a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," says Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command References, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts," the report stated. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressional Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force into life after listening to them that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations in the Centcom report are ongoing by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which agree with some of the conclusions of the republican task force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a moderately restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said the supreme democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, such as Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "instituted the morals among analysts and" gave too little room for divergent opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no indication of any intervention of the White House at Centcom analysts regarding a" "certain political opinion". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "The Daily Beast". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who received complaints from Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, announced in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congress, while investigations of the general inspector would still be underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important topics of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the depreciation of the Islamic State reminds of the feuds of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, saw a written piece about how the then government conducted under George W. Bush in contrast to the recommendations of many analysts and gave little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker confirms that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, the government did not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centre's dams commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">"the United States gains fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Britain is before"</seg>
<seg id="2">"a day after shooting three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not part of the people who keep their doors alive.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Briton in the first place, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the first placed will take a little longer to the strong Dutch, who lead the other group."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a startling whirlwind through their success story, four years after they were landing at the last London Games in the last of 12 squares."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey player in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at Drexel University), at 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"we did not have the workload in London, which we now have."</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely torn the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gates in the first half of the game with a backlash from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without winning the tournament, but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and luped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous matches."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and unavoidable, a rapid relay between competition and pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is handed over by the wristband to float to the gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the coffeeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's black with dimples, could have been under these known names to be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, in part in the shadow are the sports which are not commonly recognized: airguns, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the nipples and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparsely the last 16 years that many people, I had questioned, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who want to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bearded enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonary trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnasium and diving, the two sports which essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling movements (turning, piercing and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to execution, level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medallions must go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal oriented aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel at watching these games as a little tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be reached through the sprue and the objective of male athletes - as the male US-gymnasts recently hit the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air rinse, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are breaking on the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that sixty protesters were killed during collisions with the police during shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government shook the country and spread more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people burst into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's answer was unmerciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police officers shot and killed on umpteen non-armed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people smash young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorists across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to dominate the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or to jail, killed or driven into the vast expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stranglehold on the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, utilize the turbulence and rearouse themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of self-indulgence under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, very many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians declared that they were so protesting against them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly come from Christian countries, in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is changing just too.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a umbrella," "said MULATU Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unimaginably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in an unpublished disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in taking early signs of discontent and using special officers to edit enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively inscrutable reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a upheaval in 2005, after protesting thousands against elections, which, according to the analysts, apparently fuelled from the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and that time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal suspicion of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, a shaman city, attacked by Tigray, attacked businesses and hatred towards the Tigray became more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights across the neighbouring Somalia, even if it recently concluded that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his statement Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings about his comrades who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump impeded regarding the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the allegation perfectly serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wished to weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism hit Mr. Trump as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would give suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clintons's e-mails, but later he said" Of course, I said that sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language limits in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans, how they arrive, and then possibly" clarify "according to how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vaguely enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump assumed an even more estimated tone, because his demand values continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday revealed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general attempts to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he emphasises in the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent caregivers, gave great effort to defend candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "said Mr. Giuliani so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in this sense it is true that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called it rear-brokers, completely false, and therefore it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, miserable "television experts trying to understand him and said," You cannot!. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked over Mr. Trumps dismissal than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt accepted his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Waterproof soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"its menu on that day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" "Chop Suey" "traded Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small snack bar at the Flatiron District, which is already in store since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter deposited Hackbraten, this found the couple for a discussion about food in the Era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut, liver and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that elongated the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years prior to the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male Fellows and it was served freshly baked pasted for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war." "a Square Meal" "shows the ways in which the country was surrounded, no longer be the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for Americans was a central, tense issue," Coe told why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casserole became staple food, the casserole recovered as a" wonderful species, food leftovers, "Ziegelman noticed that cooks could hide unappetitious ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely serene luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried, as a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onion with peanut butter, too."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," "says Coe."</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the house recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever, fiscal economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were the eating habits of the country in such a way."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "household police" "and the challenge of turning Pampe such creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland shark: the oldest cyclone is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hay usually only comes to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an examination on board the ship Sanna, this shark was allowed to return to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönland hay will only get young people with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely swims the Greenland-shark along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches just 1.220 metres in average."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates on satte 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this way of slowness, however, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "Science" "at any rate from a Greenland-shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolution biologist presumes for a long time, Greenland hay is stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland hay is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the Greenland-hay lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time lupunced them, as they made six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver that tortures from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Spitsbergen as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the nucleus of the shark using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, after the early 1960s, their birth should be reduced to the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, the lenticular nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons in which 220 centimeters in length contain a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons. it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all the larger Greenland-hay, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lineage, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Grönland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters would be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold for sexually mature and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland hay obviously has at least one and a half centuries time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane problems live mainly in icy waters is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old harpoon pointed, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often expires on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal leaves heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the seafarers unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next round trip of all ministers in two years, the Federal Minister of Education of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"several pilgrimage destinations were checked and one finally decided to visit the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered at the Freiburg Minster."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern were on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Fr. Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim crosses and parted the Pilgrims."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a Münster young loved woman is standing and so the Pilgrimage moved from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the minis of field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made a rest to sing together a song from a specially arranged pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, parish homes of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and powerful dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after that, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but in the heat of the heat the heat had to be lowered about 500 metres and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue on the beach at the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter, we went to the closing stage to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived in the late afternoon at Freiburg Minster and passed through the gate of mercy."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last evening in the Men's Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. the JUNGand made the legend proudly when he rushed home to visit a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy clinched the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after returning in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the withdrawal Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in good time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Schotten, which has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner made an olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinds came back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, moving in a higher gear to slow it down and to allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell down Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We placed an olympic record in the final round and the world champion defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenny and Hoys site, Hindi admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped onto the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He drew this statement back later and there was no appeal against England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an overlooked victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"said:" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team during the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">With so many world titles we got so badly that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the deodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That's the case of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which will start today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I only enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"the World Record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had argued yesterday with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team is relying on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a char of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, drama did not play in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bobbling allegations, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite later than could be the legendary reputation that has reached its culmination at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to cancellation of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminum melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplied energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect, could be at risk at a closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominoes, as the melting shop consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses some money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting shop," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "securing business", "which should have come into effect from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already cancelled the value of the contracts in its annual drop of $187 million in" "anticipation of a cancellation". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to expel the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt, or to ensure the supply of power to the melt "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation of why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Melting Port in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of the analysts at the start of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that around 600 megawatts and Tomago consume around 900 megawatts of electricity each year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [power market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set this would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="6">"this poses the stereotyped action nearly every birthday septum of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you?, "with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kim's great sister Kim likes it, as for the vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most widely-selling edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference, which is more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were advertised by the 832 pages of the author's 615 pages advertising)."</seg>

<seg id="15">"but even with the small probability that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">"these celebrities are not related to famous people, or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if it applies to Jenner)."</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment sector.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>

<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "The Mistresses of the Eye."</seg>

<seg id="2">"e-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, Nokia Communicator came to the market."</seg>
<seg id="3">The followers now dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The unit weighed nearly half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not well in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather bulky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, which would now range for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nokia 9000 Communicator arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as" "Office in the West pocket format". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything has been different."</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was finally sold and wound to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today's vendors dominate the market all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"being online anywhere and anytime, this is everyday for a lot of people's everyday lives."</seg>
<seg id="26">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, it represented the biggest attraction heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics drew a great advantage for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we will alone offer 10,000 new apprenticeships for our local communities, creating 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blink on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each question asked question."</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in corporate growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred to a presumed suicide by several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman set off in the Dark" in an act of desperation "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years, which was passed by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said these as well as every witness of the incident to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases, in which one person ran in the dark on the highway, it was decided that the drivers don't have to assume that a pedestrian walketh in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus probably was once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if Venus could once have revealed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turning of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variation to shelter life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow movement of Venus is exposed to its tagging of the Sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although she was probably inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years - was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their water vapor was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogenesis, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide emanated with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, the way we know it today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star loops, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the coloring programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an opt-off, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as to archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and clears the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stopped."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware is canceled."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German firms involved reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they tell their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to bargain partly hard and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus supplier Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week.

<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four people."</seg>

<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-l-diesel tested with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V due to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart temper reacts to the recognition of traffic signs and throttles if necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel are alright.</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 Euro."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one rolls around for hours. at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think about sleep long before waking."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances express?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one sees in the meantime is, however, the insomnia, that is, an inlet and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German household medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind this, organic, psychological or behavioural factors can also be used as medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleeping disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is particularly common in case of depression," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors determine each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a band failure, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to salute over everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and compromised the day should go to the doctor, advises weeds."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite different: one is downcast, tired, unslept, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Dr. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary Dorental Medical Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, is hardly available in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, advises weeds."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleep laboratory medicine, for example, in snoring with breath-taking, in case of sickness, in sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make lunch hibernation," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping-ends on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of decks where you can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weaving count on: regular sleep and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin interior senator Henkel has spoken out several times for a hard police action against the project, called the" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after leaving the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrol three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>

<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words "Left-Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes charges objectionable damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house near the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is weightlifting: people in the 94 are their neighbors who are certainly not."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine's client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there, the husbandment of Wollmilkowa, which is above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as a result, some - less ridiculing than much on the multitude of tasks required - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administrative authority with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, was also sought after."</seg>
<seg id="10">"administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle honored and full-time players. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the annexation.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the land council office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"it didn't work until now, so you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be erased as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Kunde. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or helping housework, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here are administration and volunteers."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central, that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever evolves the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problems, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this was a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two most recent events fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine says quite clearly" "what some naive might call". "a residual risk cannot and would not exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">The helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also the topic of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins put them completely on their call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"they have always in the background, that soon a new push for refugees and migrants to Urbach could come."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher, too, have already been utilised to integrate the previous people reasonably."</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
