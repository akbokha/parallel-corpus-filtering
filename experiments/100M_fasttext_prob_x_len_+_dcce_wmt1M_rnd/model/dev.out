Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes the perpet@@ ual settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal struck by Obama for the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the U.S. Congress , which was partly classified as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend has shot dead &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told a somewhat sensitive voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand written note that was rit@@ tered on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who ran into two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency one day after .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were happy about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Lamb in a book written by him , Schmidt himself mentioned in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both submitted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , some incl@@ inations were too problematic . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed to be a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; latest amendments to the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic route to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police finally found a lam@@ bs when he was back in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she thinks he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pe@@ dagog@@ y . &quot;
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of pe@@ dagog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
he was the black woman at that time .
&quot; all the girls were melting there when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had been friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb arrived Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both appearing on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a B@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes Entertainment Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on night 5th September for the last time that Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony . &quot;
&quot; mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt attended the Mah@@ n@@ wache , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will resume on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency after he shot dead , and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us say that there won &apos;t be as many Christmas season associates as last year , but the toy and baby products traders say that he will give the currently employed staff and season workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plan to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip the shops with employees who sell , ship and distribute products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox v@@ eils his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated crow@@ ing and a length of arms away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ antly the biggest time travel movie that has ever been shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ emas in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ solu@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull up Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks at surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of the nom@@ ination of the real estate che@@ que . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s popularity values have rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early stages .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they would either be &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same excitement as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next in things of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters den@@ ying that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first Pre @-@ election State of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
&quot; when they put their money in money , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Republi@@ cans were gathering around another candidate , Tru@@ mp suggests almost everybody . &quot;
some experts suggest that the fragmented array probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while the anti @-@ trust support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is harvesting the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters will support Tru@@ mp , say they have committed their voices firmly . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and nobody can really say that never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; ever since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ si@@ veness of Tru@@ mp will hold crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the new @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey from Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the li@@ mel@@ ight is left , Donald Tru@@ mp apparently also do it . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; meanwhile , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Republi@@ cans in Congress with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential properties in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ look@@ en@@ weg , there is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; meaning the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter most costs .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the price comes from the price of Pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked . &quot;
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian Dream Rel@@ aun@@ ching thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two @-@ fold Tor@@ ch@@ man in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the wit@@ ch@@ craft of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their spectacle in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es Hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth course success in series will be the first step in the direction of Fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; on his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership , Müller received good assistance from the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who suffered a shot of the world champion in the Champions League . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; had Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm , before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly , but often to work with their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by the reloc@@ ation to the left outside of Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed by O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i towards the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ eck .
&quot; during the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ye Brown beat the pole ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by direct take the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual game , Pir@@ äus was able to put needle stit@@ ches . &quot;
but on the door@@ ke@@ epers of Manuel Neu@@ er he was dec@@ eived .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ste@@ ered ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; prior to Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola , Guardi@@ ola set up a square with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Götz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero first gave the green light after the final training , said Sport@@ forum Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky , &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ ale in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly confused Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went out with ram@@ bling against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only hurt the lungs , but also the teeth - this is a question of a long @-@ term study of Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : when reno@@ unc@@ ing ren@@ unciation , the risk sin@@ ks fast . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely around 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major causes of tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , empha@@ sizes DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to frequent g@@ um inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk , but within a short period of time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health up to the high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking reduces the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer to rem@@ n@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , arche@@ ologists of the Roman German@@ ic Museum have du@@ g skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always added as a department of archaeological ground @-@ conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents has already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman in the train station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern &quot; &quot; is killed , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; through the capture of the train , she has carried he@@ avi@@ est injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by lif@@ egu@@ ards .
&quot; over the reason of the ni@@ ghtly Glei@@ s@@ crossing of the young woman , there are no evidence to the medi@@ ating officials . &quot;
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; there are residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ bä@@ cker@@ strasse , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to den@@ ounce the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way of functioning well corresponds to more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;
the Swe@@ de preferred to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ee con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
&quot; so far , the process parties agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , an objection to their jud@@ gements was not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system were not familiar with fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work towards an international investment court according to their own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) above all are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration Cour@@ ts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , on which companies can stab@@ bed the tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or reduce consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals by the European Commission as insufficient . &quot;
it was particularly critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as big progress . &quot;
&quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in the spring with other EU @-@ Commerce Ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the ailing opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; to date , however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was supposed to be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; beside him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
&quot; he talks on the basis of various places , which he repeatedly draws on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and soft arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative mad@@ man . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart @-@ composed songs , which blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , can be dri@@ fting at any time into great op@@ ul@@ ent dri@@ fting . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our of &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; is created . &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ather@@ ed series : each of the 50 federal states should be said in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine @-@ proximity already &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; appeared and breaks positive expectations . &quot;

&quot; a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Chang@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide acclaimed masterpiece .

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic pieces of items . &quot;
&quot; this sixth regular studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs have desc@@ ended , the stage shows are shown here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although here nearly 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the considerably more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; disk &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Fra@@ stri@@ ches of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Fra@@ stri@@ ches of the Prime Minister
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and for the first time put on David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony commemor@@ ated the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is the focus of several title pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour president to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported it as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit on profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are taking place in order to remove all the idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ unning Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire is too face @-@ to @-@ face , and that he will refra@@ in from &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; and the strike with ref@@ uses and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle - the shadow of economic minister - will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also told the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the shelter , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ em@@ le theatre , &quot; often linked to the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire with the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Po@@ und increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rose ab@@ rup@@ tly according to data , which indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK increased by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est estimates of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,5@@ 505 and was climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 to 0.@@ 84 % vis @-@ à @-@ vis the euro . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump , after taking over supply of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition corporation for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again recorded growth .
&quot; stocks of Glen@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining industry said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt settlement . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had placed his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
JD sporting increased by 3.1 % after the sports conversion company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages are je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ing expansion .
&quot; the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
&quot; Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; 21 years young , a pendant with a super@@ star FR@@ ISE . &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .

&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation of U@@ 17 turns through .
how Wi@@ k@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster hangs up in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if ever .
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fulfil her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory school@@ ing ?
whom do it be ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bie@@ ber himself is not .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertising break of the Super@@ bow@@ ls he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , one two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ impl@@ es company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like him and over the counter , Bie@@ ber also k@@ assi@@ zes . &quot;
&quot; if Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ ings too far .
&quot; others stress , Bie@@ ber is finally in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to No. 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster brings Leban@@ ese to potato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
&quot; both - in the potato dome , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ propriet@@ or Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he saw acci@@ dentally on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a grill sk@@ ewer in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has now been submitted to the Leban@@ ese by the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with his customers , the culinary understanding of the people is good . &quot;
met@@ cash starts ground fight campaign to combat aging
met@@ cash seeks to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale tra@@ der Met@@ cash launched a soil management campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million dollar of Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes specimens in I@@ GA stores and sell shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell cheap tickets to the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances will conduct its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher margins than Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ millions of sales per year and € 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost approximately 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business rose by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s foodstuffs and food stores , which approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects operating debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ alers however , however , inv@@ ests and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to rep@@ licate sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores through fast growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive officer , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that price adjustments and shop refurbish@@ ment programs will go to Elan , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ ro and deserves praise for his own behaviour , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka during the Montreal Masters at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee with Har@@ rison : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ ro , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp had spark@@ ed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was stand@@ still defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am quite proud of is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drawn into the conflict , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he broke down a ra@@ cket when he lost the US Open because of a cr@@ amp@@ age , but he is not the first player who has thrown a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ ril the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long @-@ term solid component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ro &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; it increases in the eyes of the public , and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think for appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency state , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the state of emergency and broke the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to enter the country illeg@@ ally . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indign@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip at the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; open the border &quot; and sm@@ ashed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks will have to take place with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc could not agree on a joint immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ shad@@ owed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would accommodate more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stood out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and ha@@ sten asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country also plane the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were used in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most incoming business refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher pen@@ alties for convic@@ ted human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , expected next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , a country @-@ security advisor to Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people while trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by hur@@ ting the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of the off@@ ence of crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are there to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to impose themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway compound between Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US foreign minister H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins it against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ elling for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders made some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage in older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit projection in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries nationwide say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
maybe not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic most of all by her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the pre @-@ elections democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and elec@@ tability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den doesn &apos;t decide to channel for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head increases before S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win elections ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second one in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; vot@@ er &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on elec@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters than unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates give good results in some important features for voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister are still being asked , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions in total . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of ten who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters will also see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , get good notes under guidance . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cutting hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many don &apos;t think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp for nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ veying under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins governor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest point , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son enters the poll@@ s - it lands with 19 % support in the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp a lot ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tru@@ mp found some side @-@ ups for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if top values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing ur@@ fers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ der@@ ers are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Brotherhood seized Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally attacked during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been charged with tied eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while trying to walk over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and supposed to wait an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to bring advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle above Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly added injuries to head , h@@ ull and thi@@ ghs again with bl@@ unt force . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ es of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies each year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic attacks and forming a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - this has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold this accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming and the house will be sha@@ ken , rendering for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little instructions on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US central bank have so severely under@@ lined that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates , but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could determine that the entire excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment hits , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that capital gains will be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in more detail , the market is in the last 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after it ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with a current analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , Chief Investment strategi@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to appear later in the increase cycle , and returns the margin to decrease . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases they often promote .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate the recession . &quot;
not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP was under 4.5 percent for the 118 franc investments since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to last and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have joined the F@@ ed interest rates throughout the year , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strategi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the erosion cycles from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights are quickly put in the shade after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; firm income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates the increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease is carried out in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the exp@@ en@@ sion cycle , the lawyers return immediately , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strategi@@ sts of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a curve of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the earnings curve has increased , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large enterprises , companies that engage in the greater part of their business operations in the US , benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts become worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their stocks also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers may see gains by higher yields , even if experts are of different opinion how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Conserv@@ atives Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itate The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the program The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 turns to Classic FM , maintains a leader in parliament and ex@@ poses new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham said also to the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differenti@@ ates from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously known examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC general director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to public music and public education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music . &quot;
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work would be needed to engage the audience when it happened in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sport , was under fire to join the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall was insi@@ sting that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment is star@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed up spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales were reinforced three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ ing , and we may experience that growth decreases . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers hold their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers sha@@ ved around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers rus@@ hed off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 issues a little more than 1 £ online was issued .
&quot; in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried the in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially ob@@ stru@@ cts the breakdown of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane crashed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed as a crane to Mec@@ ca Gros@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , dressed largely in white , the route to make their respect , when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession with@@ drew to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell upon the praying . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for funeral , when the Saudi King hung over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 sor@@ es who were killed , when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ é Mak@@ kas , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr. Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ man will go to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today king Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group would not have allowed to ste@@ al the arm of the crane than he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company is prohibited foreign travel . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ é , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims fell before the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of not current security measures and because it did not co @-@ operate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group .
&quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia and has been taking over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
officials ordained that 1 Million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other wounded will get half of this amount .

&quot; it is said that British to submit their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men , who carry out their work in their home . &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully dealing with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; for British increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said it is necessary to face growing demographic trends , which exhibit more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and financial support . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the group ow@@ es the costs for closing the stores .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and task @-@ raising .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of minist@@ erial abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the accused in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds of the association &apos;s accounts of which they were allowed to operate in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he deci@@ ph@@ ered the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constru@@ ed that the association was at no time an asset in the asset . &quot;
&quot; sports officials only had expenses compens@@ ated and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money . the Passi@@ ve amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or lock it ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ vocation of the chief audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said at the capture . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of financial success , the payout of expenses for expenses had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; so you have paid off some of the expenses only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the former ob@@ man explained the operations . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts shared the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association has not been disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in detail for financial support , important was only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against which one function@@ ary investigation began on account of office abuse , an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that were set@@ backs , the def@@ endants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified . &quot;
this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; claims for damage . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been a det@@ ri@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never made a cent pay , he only charged o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he charged 1,000 euros per month for di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher however , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
&quot; these were after an operational test , where everything was considered correct , no longer kept , declared them . &quot;
the second def@@ endant also referred to o@@ dom@@ eter money .
&quot; in his statement , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces further 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the personnel reduction that has been running for three years , the computer terri@@ fic will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions of the US computer terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had a workforce of around 300,000 associates . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard shares 2.3 percent later on the stock market .
&quot; the company &apos;s large @-@ scale company from Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separately from the more advanced areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers , according to its services , ranked the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; in this way , the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP respon@@ ds to changes in the industry with a split and massive sub@@ missions .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man only later re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and always do more and more shops online . &quot;
&quot; as a whole , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans have a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly result in rejection : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent had agreed to agree . &quot;
&quot; the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; cooperation with Syrian leaders Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad rests 51 per cent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred applied refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the violence break@@ age at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind that a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a floo@@ d@@ light ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sticks , and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials first put an un@@ interrupted pe@@ pper@@ spray .
&quot; after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
much of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a little back .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees caught in themselves and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pe@@ pper@@ spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the U.S. staff comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for nearly a decade , interest rates have been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a little longer and will hold interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has placed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death cap at the Delta State University Re@@ duc@@ ed Deb@@ t
&quot; after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - wrote Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb a note to say that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; he could make it un@@ due , &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer on ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he hath shed upon a man , and a man put to death . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency station that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came to the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb gained 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally res@@ um@@ ed his own life on Monday night as polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb since about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen adopted him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; Lamb gained a doc@@ torate in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , such as his life of life on the university &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who have lost their luck charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ time partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession . &quot;

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group transformation .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 managers around the world will cost the Group structure to the workplace . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its business structure and upgrades the cheap Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline shared on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a board member for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
&quot; in the future , the Managing Director of Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the re @-@ establishment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which places three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict of collective bar@@ gaining with the pilot @-@ association cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed after the scheduled strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; in one year , cock@@ pit wants to come with a predicted record result as quickly as possible to yield results . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , the conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the concept of &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competi@@ tor routes , Lufthansa puts Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor routes to the group &apos;s own low @-@ speed Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven in the Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign def@@ ender to we@@ eping and exclude it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red Card and the hanging of an elf .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United will suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V failure
&quot; with the European Championships in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland @-@ Team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron has better known The Lor@@ ax ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost out . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead returns a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss sang Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this wasn &apos;t enough enough : the text submitted by Cameron is partly like the summary of the video of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , hoping to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy sounds like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ ading , counter @-@ frustr@@ ating beings who speak in the name of trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but there were no other immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly under threat from the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; to push Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive outlook . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th Separ@@ ates from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to ski@@ p Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that te@@ amm@@ ers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the Great Britain @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his stance , even though he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer I treasure high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een beside Cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receive four ticks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; she might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he started as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred clicks immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball @-@ sphere of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
&quot; and you have to remember that , as with players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not made easy by heart .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ auf , if the economy goes into a F@@ illing Device until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ vent new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to Leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who was heavily disper@@ sed because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at &apos;s boy@@ friend said that some member states are so deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always out of their own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contractual changes that they usually do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; my European friend , who would like an outside Britain outside the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance races such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a blo@@ ating force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will break up a leg to help the self @-@ lead British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally un@@ inten@@ tionally plan un@@ helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ zone , as they did during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 however , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries that most of our major newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributed ban@@ anas to dist@@ ra@@ ct him instead of being at his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir when he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never seen him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly li@@ qu@@ or on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any more time to waste me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ th anniversary , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it nicely - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of UK@@ IP &apos;s traditional anti @-@ dy@@ e tendency and the wild ent@@ our@@ age of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns nom@@ ination of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ ies when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their day on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touched bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a ne@@ sting of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with its B@@ enn@@ ite Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ ti@@ bly convinced that J@@ C doesn &apos;t launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start of Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write into BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic public health principle is that strategies should be based on proving efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer to obtain , but not the funding he should have received after reports before the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the P@@ he was also part of the P@@ he . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions is discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; were premature .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by identifying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ enders , former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC to publicly review programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ deb@@ ated time @-@ windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ er- is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I would like to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comment@@ aries on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart teaching in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC should sell shows such as East@@ bourne . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcast charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window where no one wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee , &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , we all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , I wonder if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the public @-@ legal broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters Alli@@ ances go down to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by erup@@ tions of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pul@@ ses work by turning mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
another theme for this topic : researchers are reading and writing brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure which gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ ound waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , the wor@@ ms changed gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when using ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that pro@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ imp@@ eded and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic viral it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stations and in the subway trains and which require a second look . &quot;
&quot; important notice : drive from 15th to 18th September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read in the font types of the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into a picture of a tank . &quot;
&quot; in September , a flock of arms dealers will go with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the weapons trade show . &quot;
the 300 posters are artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for cruel designs in Ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
&quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ pack of Allen key encryption , which claims that &quot; access to around a third of the bus stops across the planet . &quot;

&quot; after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the public outside of galleries . &quot;
many artists engage with activists in protest movements to work and realize that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets the comm@@ u@@ ters in the underground .
&quot; Am@@ nesty @-@ Video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who also works for free . &quot;
V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the weapons fair - by a void of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid .
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic amor@@ ph@@ ous corporate advertising , but by the blu@@ eb@@ ird with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is an action of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
&quot; perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors laugh fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago I went as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ table 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , long @-@ armed complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the move into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve w@@ re@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ew : people tell wh@@ ence you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ era where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract CH@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages recep@@ tions , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people prefer to dress up and use their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start with the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted patients receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ st@@ rolling culture , which is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it an SMS instead .
talking pos : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship through baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of men to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I gave you something baked . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made delicacies is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ om@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly missed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in residence halls .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my ro@@ ommate , who added to her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they wanted to make something quiet for them , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly asked her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same residence hall ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future marriage partner , dis@@ connect them , and then see them every day , and perhaps experience how they come across all the common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future wife , try at least to speak a little reason to your abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying f@@ one , as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good trick is fun , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by hiding a valuable and enjoyable lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close their door , and put their keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but don &apos;t stap@@ le your pos@@ sessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner is building in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; thus for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the alone educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can still build good and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds on a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for the people are staying in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need enough housing in the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ ders : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are taught in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily changed according to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ der : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?

&quot; Gil@@ dner : true is true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but they were built luxury apartments that hardly can afford any more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght dies or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is re@@ charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to be continued , as the phone may run on half way and this could result in a crash of the update . &quot;

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the old geri@@ at@@ ric centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new start @-@ up office at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; besides consultations , one can also take part in courses there . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends it down from the mountain into the city centre .
&quot; more specifically , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently , many services of the insurance companies are not used because the complexity of insurance policies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new house@@ wife Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center will see both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential .
&quot; in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district council also devoted itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular soci@@ able gather@@ ings . &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years passed away
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , like the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mon@@ ster : on Friday evening , at around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mon@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a sevent@@ een year old Afghan , followed by the police according to the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft station . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot;
&quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young , and struck them with their f@@ ist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen .
&quot; also , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Con@@ veyor U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ stand@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller again opened the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the field of rock was getting to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who are currently completing their medical practice at Ver@@ den &apos;s hospital and who wants to enter into practice this year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage could fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just inv@@ oked her . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage farmers bought the house with practice .
&quot; meanwhile , they will continue to live in break@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time father Frank Müller also grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover studied stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently employed as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in addition he was appointed senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and involved in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ readiness Candi@@ do @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as general practitioners . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros will receive the gar@@ bage in the framework of a funding programme of the district ( 25@@ 0,000 Euro ) and the congregation ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the community ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come to the practice Fel@@ stand@@ ausen every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
&quot; in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is another house doctor &apos;s office . &quot;
a positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultations , by the way looks also mainly in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the field of origin . &quot;
&quot; with their part@@ ing ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly feel it after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients very often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always kept myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also made up on our southern border , &quot; said Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so . &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Sloven@@ ian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel towards Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; this is how this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slov@@ ene wants to lock its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government claimed , the first refugees had already tried to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police cars are constantly meeting new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country expects about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Foreign Affairs R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Serbian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted to Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ b media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day other buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Macedonia border , about 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ lying route to the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkans @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since then have a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the reports of the media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to so@@ ot@@ he Wednesday at a local speech in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing land maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der business on the financial markets should have been made . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators reported a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused were in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz , there is a lively operation . &quot;

&quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , spr@@ inkl@@ ing life with stunning autumn sun and in the middle of four big plates each with the title &quot; Before I die ... &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid drew attention to their 20 @-@ year existence and is definitely confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks as well as the volunteers .
&quot; while a pass@@ ant interven@@ es spontane@@ ously to chal@@ k and the sentence for &quot; my life affir@@ m , &quot; &quot; continue &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , little discussions develop over the action , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on the spot right now .
&quot; only if I make clear that for me sometime the end of this world comes , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian plant Mannheim , which is co @-@ serving with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to disclose themselves publicly to the tables is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still covered with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped many people to open up . &quot;
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and funeral attend@@ ant is one of the volunteer employees of the first hour .
&quot; faced with the topic of personal experiences , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was requested by invitation of volunteers , she immediately reported to her and was involved in the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another commodity , hold it for precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the services offered by the ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Service are free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and super@@ visions of death and trau@@ ma companions .
&quot; every two years , training courses for new employees are offered . &quot;
&quot; the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , further personal requests can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and delivering gi@@ ants decreased its profit forecast for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 65@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays . &quot;
&quot; at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the market transaction 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher supplements for body transport of heavy and large packages which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the ri@@ val UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5.000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predic@@ ting the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts asked analysts expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping which brought its sales in its unit express shipment . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in the body transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated session in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ es spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide if it &apos;s time for the first time for almost a decade to lift the dead zone . &quot;
&quot; above them at the end of the reno@@ unc@@ ed , two @-@ storey sitting room , there is a mur@@ m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other matters .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented stimul@@ us by the near zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , the latest tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets may make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rise in interest rate this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strategi@@ sts can sof@@ ten the blow by promising a further increase far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm down the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , she would expect more economic progress , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , whereby the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the high level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when to raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not have occurred , in this session , they would attract the re@@ ins , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Cur@@ ren@@ cy Administration has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , dissolved ple@@ dges around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , can be expected by the F@@ ed representatives to monitor not only the developments in another place , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ er , vo@@ iced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest increase , quoted Dec@@ isions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia enabled the F@@ ed to lower its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives undo those cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest increase because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not believe that it should advance the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany these days .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is teacher with body and soul .
she is also very fond of her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday she does it in the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Bern@@ ina sports ground is progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent municipal meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction request without big discussions was unanim@@ ously approved . &quot;
&quot; previously , among other things , the body had decided to apply for a &quot; &quot; author@@ itative &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid planning plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; , &quot; permission was granted for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ t first and roof top &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; it was again about the roof incl@@ ination , which is prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the planning plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thereby significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan to the roof incl@@ ination does not allow &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council is generally more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create any preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
&quot; in the next stage of the proceeding , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Board of Directors for the review . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new Medical Director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these are the surprising plans of the hospital of the county , confirmed by the landlord Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg would be employed . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further inside station .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to follow the follow @-@ up came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was a &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
fishermen are specialists in pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , fis@@ her with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree on both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ie , which has more than 35 beds , shall be finally closed at Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current renov@@ ations at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital are completed . &quot;
&quot; the landlord J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Treasury , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß failed to say , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity doesn &apos;t come back , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi @-@ move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positively and very intel@@ li@@ gible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as chief doctor for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the position of the Medical Director .
&quot; the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the handful of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ischen HC tonight .
&quot; the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is none . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the s@@ wimm@@ ers had a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and made something good there . &quot;
Jag@@ dun@@ ov with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hun@@ ts@@ men were in use as the police shared . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could happen to the accident , was initially unclear . &quot;
the Cri@@ min@@ ate Police as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old said to killed the young and cast their dead into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; one of the 16 year olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a suspect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man is also arrested on Tuesday night , who was , according to the indications , and led the investig@@ ators to the locality of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a fall festival .
&quot; in search of a young woman , investig@@ ators first found personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; during surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances , there was finally a crime of crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee report@@ edly admitted that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be scre@@ ened to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead . &quot;
conclusions about the closer circumstances of the act are to take the further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warns about apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a decent stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; Social Housing &quot; &quot; alliance deb@@ its . &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; that is where 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and lined up into the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , there were less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is pushing a housing deficit , which will grow from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , around 77@@ 0,000 units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , lam@@ ented Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of WG rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; suggests a restart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the tax rate tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the properties for subsidi@@ zed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the alliance requires attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options . &quot;
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well established in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , at 184 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia address Cor@@ ridor
&quot; in Hungary there is practically no diar@@ rho@@ ea , there are more and more refugees trying their way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the separation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrived in Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
&quot; on the eve of the day , Hungary closed its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually redundant . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian Police arrested the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most originate media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and taxis into the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not stum@@ ble on border fence . &quot;
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees coming to Hungary . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 un@@ challenged people .
shortly before closing the Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal off@@ ense .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south@@ hung@@ arian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the sentences threatened to sentence up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the newly established &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; , &quot; almost all - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two older people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected the gar@@ bage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
locking lat@@ tices were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border place was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself for the purpose of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria has only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government declarations . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy on Sunday after the bridge , when suddenly ten people were standing by suit@@ cases at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; on Sunday , however , because of the refugee flow , Germany had surprisingly set up the rail traffic with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Ne@@ ar Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we left the unexpected guests at first , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded ten@@ si@@ le passengers had switched on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but to try again over the border . &quot;
the regional train was stopped off the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Bridge Festival , with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , soci@@ alized on Sunday , before a two @-@ bridge run - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent further thousands to us now , a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy is : &quot;
&quot; instead of assi@@ sting in the camps of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially put up the Hungarian government &apos;s attitude towards National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states in the border areas .
&quot; also the refugees have to find that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter , to make Dec@@ ent states for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quartz &quot;
&quot; Konrad , with the transfer of refugees , has all hands to do . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the first emergency center , Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , already got a grip on Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the housing of the 20.000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without great vor@@ tices , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ y achievement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects about 8@@ 5.000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ned year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; they would have secured him , even for the refugees to come . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria , it runs fine , &quot; &quot; said F@@ erry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can offer accommodation on the platform easily .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of need , it could not be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to maintain a certain amount of the towel bracket or size of the over@@ cast . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior at placing more successful , Konrad establishes with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er are not responsible for the Republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , your own quest for Qu@@ arti@@ s has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz demands a better distribution
&quot; initially , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since it is possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suitability . &quot;
criticism of the city manager on the allocation of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) co@@ ded on Monday the further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the search @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , it is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the General refurbish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; New Shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also to acquire them .
&quot; already from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the state Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 sqm remaining space in the building have already been rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market arcade : after all , she has now grown into another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks were reconstructed . &quot;
&quot; but I thought for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the great room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has put her mother laid in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women facing a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the professional woman with the last certainty . &quot;
maybe it is because a nice bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
&quot; this property also connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he expresses himself extern@@ ally , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office will raise the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ on@@ aires originate . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dres@@ ser is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ site is related over sixty corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps , to which alongside Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - zu High German : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to homeland , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , was declared a film start . &quot;
Williams is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just like the polish , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a Born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born &quot; Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er retired in retirement , &quot; &quot; he is always so dist@@ rac@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the pension scheme Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm is mentioned like some k@@ all@@ stadt , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t win the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 kin@@ dre@@ ds , also in the United States aw@@ akes the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1,@@ 800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
there are already 20 mountain climbing villages in Austria .
&quot; in the neighboring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show . &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son are rus@@ hing to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the Liber@@ als leadership , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s ratings . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the Federal Capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull executed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this draw@@ back of the stand@@ still seemed to play no part for Australian TV spectators , as Sunrise generated an average 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , in comparison with today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today announced a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
&quot; in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance travelled between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September , sunrise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning men more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could play a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e sur@@ passed on average 44@@ 6,000 people . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia delivered 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour a total of 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to rush into the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana &apos;s Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are perhaps un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obviously who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before leaving three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips closed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have eased in ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , their answers could become game corrupt who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki did both quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt they were quite compatible , and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that wood was &quot; the one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when asked , who Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ led . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m. &quot;
initially published as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ den had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ den for the rest of the game as he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ verti@@ t on Tuesday at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
&quot; but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ den the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return , and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his p@@ atz@@ ted catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ den p@@ atz@@ t with a P@@ unt , who was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , den Hay@@ den and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ den left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; says Hay@@ ton . &quot;
Hay@@ den compared the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ den posed for a photo with fans , holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ ag@@ ram . &quot;
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
&quot; Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian area with arms . &quot;

&quot; because of the high number of refugees , free elec@@ tors are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the F@@ W autumn retreat in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Day faction of Free voters ch@@ ases until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they existed during the Yugoslavia during the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the Administr@@ ative Cour@@ ts , which are responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we bro@@ aden national standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria postpon@@ es , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more viable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy in the big wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ term permanent torch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Education Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; middle level plus &quot; at 47 high school students , in which an extension of the secondary school of three to four years is tested . &quot;
but that is not far enough for Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic &quot; G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
&quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools , who want this . &quot;
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot;
celeb@@ r@@ ity Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on jumps
&quot; after a long distance , the German stock market was closed with profits over long distances . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon , a strong start of the U.S. stock exchanges took a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the discussion about the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record @-@ deep and also left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; according to a retailer , a positive report from the U.S. landing magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; worked on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors gave little attention to the German chip manufacturer . &quot;
investments in future @-@ oriented w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA claimed at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the papers of the coaches Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2,@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot;

4 people killed after police officers shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of you threw stones and bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before it res@@ um@@ ed on rubber layer .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber layer used , of which it is known that they can indeed kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally regulated for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 sq.@@ m. in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; you wait for corresponding offers , it is said from the city . &quot;
which investor come into question is not yet clear .

&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the management sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors right now .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; during the meeting , the images and new details of the desired hotel building were highlighted . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , landlord and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge appl@@ ause that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like several other project critics that the transport by the intended size of the plant would increase strongly : &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus inv@@ itations to be profitable , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first , we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google , Inc . ( O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the disclosure of the donations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager leave the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus trips , as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately searching for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide aid to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to USD 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ e@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ b@@ ular formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease infection completely dissolved and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with the type of diabetes , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Cholester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who were subjected to obesity @-@ surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without any increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ attractive for years , meets the sho@@ al of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author was raised in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe could not take up all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide ordered the end of violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama glori@@ fied Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in overcoming the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set power , and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer in children over the last 4 years
&quot; the United States reports about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of inf@@ ecting inf@@ ecting agents in children under the age of 12 reported the influ@@ x control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children are inten@@ tionally drinking dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a test in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants mixed with soft m@@ outh@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in to@@ dd@@ lers a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes from stra@@ w@@ berry fragrance inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold required by law to be drunk by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ utes her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of wall dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities staff suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York State planned to po@@ ison her &quot; gem@@ einer &quot; teacher by declar@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products circul@@ ating around the classroom , so there is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer and ban@@ ished her out of her room .
&quot; the police considered the dec@@ ei@@ ving plan as &quot; &quot; pu@@ zz@@ ling &quot; &quot; and showed disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end colli@@ sion between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and on Her@@ oes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car has been easily injured during a rear @-@ end colli@@ sion . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ pole in the direction of the roundabout industrial area and took too late that at the roundabout two predic@@ tive vehicles had stopped .
&quot; in the episode , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; at the accident involved vehicles , Sach@@ harm was created by about 10,000 euros , the police said . &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about Dis@@ harmon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was reported spontane@@ ously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team comrades are not under increasing control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ dering Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they are talking about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm Games and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic had to fight but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now faces five points ahead , clearly stood at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
war@@ bur@@ ton war@@ y in January @-@ transfers

&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said , &quot; The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; the players coming in the summer have this pre@@ season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;

&quot; sometimes , more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot;

&quot; Mc@@ Kin@@ es said : &quot; there is no team that has won anything , in Po@@ kal play or Li@@ es , the games of that sort have not won . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland is still unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland was unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the UK@@ s , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland was 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number over the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost a year ago that Scotland met the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I &apos;m Wit@@ ness of an Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ed sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma reduces the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is chosen , will watch it emoti@@ on@@ less . &quot;
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of writing my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have form@@ ulate it &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go here again for all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese &apos;s assass@@ ination would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying from an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase talks to come from the C@@ anning River
p@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was talking about the guy from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer , trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to a pet canc@@ elation incident in Becken@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman deals . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he directed the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt sample of Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too highly hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go around the head raised , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months Terr@@ y B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves in their n@@ oses , because they failed to seize me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , reig@@ ning President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ w , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly fashion and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ going cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ written Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse deb@@ its , which was viol@@ ated against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly worn mud on the leg .
it would have been like that last night .
&quot; it would have been so yesterday all day , which was so . &quot;
but it had it on the race day too .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
man arrested after driver flight

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy comes back against ri@@ vals for claims about ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy called criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly concealed note to the storm team after his team had scored the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ li@@ um of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; during tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team confident that they were worried that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that happens again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about competitions , when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a little shock for him . &quot;
it is already funny how this occurs again and again during this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we consider as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they &apos;re a bit worried to have to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against RO@@ O@@ ST@@ ERS achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and do not score a bit of tension ? &quot;
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we are still going to meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm @-@ Team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drug coll@@ age &quot;
&quot; a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later at the Cafe Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of danger at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal complaint , he weigh@@ ed the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the ice @-@ ref@@ und@@ able statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damages , under the conditions that he det@@ ects his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and stops at a starting point from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
A5 at Karlsruhe accident : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; in case of a colli@@ sion with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks participated in a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , as the police said . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ induced demoli@@ tion brake completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 am .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure p@@ ests to send pictures
a p@@ est aid used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alar@@ ming her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; p@@ est in the internet , &quot; and he &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten p@@ ests . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was at trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked a lot younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , in@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , and not to appear before court at a hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no up@@ lifting sexual element &quot; can be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael f@@ ann@@ ed the verdict by October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted security in this case , but was held in detention for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
tu@@ g@@ user switches on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up away from the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers from fear of discovery and arrest increase the number of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the River Inn River Inn , there were more than 1000 refugees in the regions of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
&quot; on foot , they were transferred to the German side by foot over bridges and con@@ ges@@ tions . &quot;
there they are received by Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; at Munich central station , according to Federal Police Regulations , more refugees arrived again on Wednesday as compared to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a deep @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently streams in the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart distributed . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic over the Atlantic Ocean last days . &quot;
heavy storms and storms are especially expected in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , up to th@@ urs@@ day early also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with goats from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun will last longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , there is mainly movement in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected in the IAA ( Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concepts and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a new entry under the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is from € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the first time also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door version . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be next to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e will only be seen as a five @-@ door Alfasud in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a station wagon . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : all new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan truck wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s declarations at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
sales start of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n liner used the front section above all : here the radi@@ ator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights with LED technology were fitted . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants at the IAA in the compact class , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Judi@@ cial Service Te@@ gel , which was housed in a cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the judges may even hope for money if only a few days were locked up in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a separate cell with about five squar@@ em@@ eters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally un@@ separated . &quot;
&quot; according to his lawyer , the man who is now on the open foot has been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his adher@@ ence of office because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re @-@ examination there . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s human dignity inj@@ ected .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons from the question@@ able period only a few days of detention for compensation shall be decisive , it was said to be a compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; so they spoke to a prisoner in April , because he was imprisoned in a cell . &quot;
&quot; un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe further confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel attack in November 2009 . &quot;
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was housed daily from 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in the last few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines due to missing personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even for hunting grounds it should have already happened because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the Jus@@ tiz@@ press@@ est@@ elle , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to offspring of offspring , 19 should be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to the statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we create it .
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 flats ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of housing , but above all for affordable rental objects : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing is out of the rental price binding , and for these particularly affordable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing must be created every year , and the federal government needs to invest EUR 6.4 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; in agreement , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in residential construction . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in the society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the perspective of the labour market has prev@@ ailed that refugees should be enabled faster to access the labour market . &quot;
the lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
&quot; until now , there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the building of networks is the royal road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration found that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ ot@@ less parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ esch@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ rails in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities - by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for classes without knowledge of German in welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk under@@ estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
&quot; for refugees , access to the university could be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because refugees with a residence or debt do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to date to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this breakdown was shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but even this financing gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get immediately B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely swe@@ ep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic Charity association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the willingness to stand up against religious fundament@@ alism is also part of this . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre and a general equality law for nearly a decade .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , systematically ignored the racial motive in the police and authorities . &quot;
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements as the anti @-@ racism convention of Germany undertake must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be poured into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all newcom@@ ers to the registration of health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be settled with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to travel so many people with the limited service catalog , which the asylum seek@@ er law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors mainly do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more aware of their illness than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; it would have helped many refugees , however , even with more general medical contact points in the ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; in refugee protests , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with young people it is about HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly different diseases , German doctors would come from their education but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect &quot; . &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors is possibly even relief in sight of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take up ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates of the Federal Chamber Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most suffer from post@@ traum@@ atic stress distur@@ b@@ ance or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child trau@@ mati@@ ses in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from post@@ traum@@ atic stress distur@@ b@@ ance suffer , among other things , at so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , per@@ sever@@ ance and fear of death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can pose a motion for psych@@ otherapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion , &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst loads into the man@@ ege on the bricks of the v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current generation of man@@ e@@ genetics . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the family thus lives in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; cocktail cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 @-@ kilometre @-@ long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the programme of Cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to take up the Cuban duo .
ease and mobility - they identify with these words .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
mis@@ understand@@ ings in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst comments also : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we do not go well . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
the top commandment thus : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid still is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
for each visitor there should be something there .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst loads between 17 and 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr. Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of opposition from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ enia .
&quot; last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ aker of Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &quot; Death , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that the imm@@ unity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot;
the boss said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build up 25,000 @-@ 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will later divide this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
&quot; the expected turn@@ out leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion in annual revenue and will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave H@@ ew@@ lett to manufacture electric installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one named &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to deal with the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field which is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate before the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les injury and then returned to his old momentum during the early season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that improvement in the infringement rate during the last season will continue . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a pr@@ one time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win strength , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favourites , go forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , judging by the judging scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
he believes that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven away from the distant hope with his management to lead the association to his first European championship victory .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as demonstrated self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more frequently in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced as the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , lif@@ eli@@ ke and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty with Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on her head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football do@@ cking in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ros@@ s to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they are often reluc@@ tant to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of teleph@@ ony ministry explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; My role for listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that come to mind , when I try to offer long @-@ lasting cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot;
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone to help people in moments of despair also may help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed setting to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the complete 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfection in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to Paris on the weekend , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 Draw on his own court against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was pi@@ er@@ ced by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defence before he passed to Joh@@ an Wil@@ and passed nicely to the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this stage , joined with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle @-@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead PS@@ G itself sometimes switched to , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ ber@@ c , which was cut in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had set him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that turned Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an increased his sixth position after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ ber@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the end result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi came to the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion in stock sales
&quot; the UK @-@ based mining giant Glen@@ core , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt settlement plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Glen@@ core &quot; &quot; registered in London in a statement that it sold new shares worth about € 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debt . &quot;
&quot; the company , which in this year lost 57 percent of its market value , is struggling with decl@@ ining commodity prices because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses the demand and has a dis@@ astro@@ us effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the head of the London Stock Exchange at retail on the early Wednesday morning .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Glen@@ core had announced that $ 2.5 billion in stock sales last week , as part of the more comprehensive plans to rep@@ ay around a third of its 30 billion $ debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new investments to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and ref@@ utes President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the U.S. President and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also be host to Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan in a state @-@ d@@ iner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks .
&quot; President Obama &apos;s visit will have the opportunity to expand American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will be able to construc@@ tively address issues of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , which was announced at first in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;
borrow@@ ed and S@@ cra@@ p 440 @-@ PS sports cars
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfil a dream and borrow@@ ed a Ford Must@@ ang .
on the wet highway then the evil Aw@@ ak@@ ening came .
at a company in the Got@@ ha district it is possible to fulfil the dream and to rent a V@@ 8 US sports car Ford Must@@ ang Boss 302 with 440 hp .
this also did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the Got@@ ha district .
&quot; on the A 71 in Arn@@ stadt , the dream came out and gone . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 transition to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago the FC Bayern stood in front of the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner &apos;s winner , four times champi@@ ons league winner , two times Club World Champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was standing before the Euro 2008 before the departure of Barcelona .
one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won all , we did nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this is also the registered FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot;
remember : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is today working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; with that , he got me excited . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time was running 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the whole distance on the grass , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the king class triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown sh@@ attered , as this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do it in the filling of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor played by The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a groove beaten by her white fe@@ eb@@ le . &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - this is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ eds and 4,000 likes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teenagers Michael Brown killed by a white police officer in 2014 , Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s Movement achieved country @-@ wide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to discrimin@@ ate against discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured amb@@ ush . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , and in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos;s Champion First Champion
Pro @-@ Sports Tour@@ er and Assi@@ stance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; the competition show , which closed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time that he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge every three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot;
as quite suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he receives the great rati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for a 2nd season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins missed a chance to climb within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card tournament .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon sustained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of any game , and so I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh interior , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed drummer Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designer @-@ designed ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust a Two @-@ Run a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the conclu@@ ding run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth , there was a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed man stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit promoted the start of the game by an even not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the vulner@@ ability list before the game had been missing more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , there was a single on Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers played in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he got the right job . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by A.@@ J. A@@ chter &apos;s rel@@ a@@ unch . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three races with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the lif@@ ter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the es@@ car@@ pment of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder license , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing since August 20 because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden ex@@ ited on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital have been prepared for this event over the past few days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there . &quot;
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the first record , had arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that resol@@ ute reflections on military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European States &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one had been happy that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends with crashing out of our front door , &quot; he said at Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; in Germany , Austria again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , but now nobody will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
also Germany did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it already gave talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;

&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ Route . &quot;
their goal is Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of additional 120,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the League will manage this together with the countries , Merkel on the late afternoon after almost four hour consultations with Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; under@@ lining Merkel , those people who exploited protection , also complain . &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ perspective cannot stay in Germany either .
this opinion was clearly divided in the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary had closed its 175 km border to Serbia during the night on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to seal the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat ev@@ asion from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condem@@ ns the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to eye @-@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of migrants are on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
room son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Saturn @-@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus a global ocean oscill@@ ates .
&quot; these include researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; Raum@@ probe &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon fli@@ cks slightly on its way around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this movement is only small , but still too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) of Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers presented their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
already longer has been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered Eis@@ volcanic kan@@ e on the South Pole of the Saturn , which sp@@ ills water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;

the 1860 München needs to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
&quot; an investigation has shown an ad@@ duction issue at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with them . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lions , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; is expected to have a period of four weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a loss of loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we must now think , &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible obligation of a un@@ compromising professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training passenger , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last in Belgium and was under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the cro@@ codi@@ le has the ability to prove his ability . &quot;

&quot; despite his first fears , he remained without a serious body . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gan@@ os contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy however : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gan@@ os but much vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; whoever e@@ ats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell comfortable . &quot;
&quot; the shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so , also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should store at room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it mil@@ ks the slightly bitter taste of some Bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ ehn partially blows with storm strength through the gro@@ oming valleys . &quot;
&quot; after gro@@ aning on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a press release , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure @-@ area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west currents . &quot;

&quot; in the wake of the fo@@ ehn until Thursday morning in the caves with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , occasional and especially in the Ur@@ i @-@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ ehn can advance to the adjacent centre of Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my gro@@ aning for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity rises at the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here sets rain , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this is expected to have huge rain@@ falls in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the blow dies off , in the wake of a cold front with strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strong to stor@@ my , and temperatures go far back . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino &apos;s presence was baptized in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live for centuries as a minority only in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place will become visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city as a vil@@ la@@ in sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions should have strengthened him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the major works of Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with su@@ mp@@ tuous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subjective @-@ artistic selection out of the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which are dedicated to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
he has thus spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ah@@ ost , who dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages that have been selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts paintings .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts to the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hate Order . &quot;
&quot; so the up@@ bringing happened once with the cane , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to get up with the Lord &apos;s Father again .
&quot; his second concern is to focus more on art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of picture worlds today is influenced by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is super@@ se@@ ded .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers go into the images , let them work on them , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image looks for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ah@@ ost died on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like him to live with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not looked at the Bible completely , but selected the most important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ah@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only clari@@ fies . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;

start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , company mand@@ ated to model earth hill for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; there were om@@ issions in politics and administration , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the rail@@ road . &quot;
&quot; so hill de@@ ported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the First Shar@@ eholder Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the child and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga assumes a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the deterior@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics to help tackle the upcoming problems . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic certainly plays a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out has to put politics .
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when on the left jer@@ sey instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship logo ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen sport manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot;
&quot; we soccer allies can , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the division . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Saale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach marked the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a great joint work of German soccer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed associations in their own locations had started their own projects is great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association will be presenting 300 000 euros in cooperation with the DF@@ B and the German government for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : head of the head of SAP loses sight of accident
&quot; Chairman of the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was impot@@ ent , and then dra@@ gged out onto the road - that he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to come to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
important is to stand up again when you fall down .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of combat ...

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of the Europa League will finally break down . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top Game against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stam@@ mer@@ ing on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Professor Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe @-@ League games in the future , Tu@@ chel left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , it will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ge statement by Mit@@ spiel@@ Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Middle @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l considers understandable : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ brin@@ dt talked on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Motor Show IAA from a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 countries , which meet representatives of industry at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transportation under@@ lines , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid growth on digital radio . &quot;
testing is currently underway on the 9 highway in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for example , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far fores@@ een only the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger . &quot;
the Bosch Group comprises Robert Bosch GmbH and its roughly 440 subsidiary and regional companies in some 60 countries .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads &quot; are to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study evaluated the study by 2025 at around € 8.4 billion . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD traffic critic S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still see self @-@ driving cars skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; well , each vi@@ zier would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;

the final decision is to fall at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ burger Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ships in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; stated Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ em@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his oeu@@ vre on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18th September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canada &apos;s Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it concerns tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete art work , for which a lot of effort was practiced : to capture the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have gone to Munich for 14 tons of material . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy will be shown in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ atively modified hous@@ ings of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later joined the throwing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as told Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but then I bought them naturally .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he has not been able to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion niche
&quot; earlier , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were created in a large quantity for customers , which they processed for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic eras , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
&quot; who does not operate ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot;
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
private res@@ ellers and wholesale dealers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; in the Asian region , mass production is produced much cheaper and almost exclusively sold over chains . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma desig@@ ner@@ in U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think about economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ invented the historical snow top .
the machine stit@@ ches little ch@@ icks in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ y Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ sse was inspired : &quot; before I could do nothing with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the United States , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings , and who want a mem@@ ento of memory . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as the modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about re @-@ cin@@ emat@@ ography , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a consultation at the 16th session of the central management group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population @-@ reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a major role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally state business environment and designed the market more open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers committed to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising requirements and making the application easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who has received a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the existing limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ World@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low loaded that they already observe the projected maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; that is why the lowering of small fish is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant dist@@ rac@@ ting maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans . it is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts can especially cause in@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explained on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is primarily through coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written report by the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run out more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total volume in Germany em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been cited in March out of paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
