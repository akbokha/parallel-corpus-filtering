&quot; a ) The organization shall take all precau@@ tions to protect business and industrial secrets as well as other confidential information , from which they have become aware of the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; II ) Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate information on core material , which is subject to securing measures according to this agreement , may be published on the Council &apos;s decision and with the consent of the directly affected states or the community , as far as each of the two parties is affected . &quot;
&quot; a ) In the implementation of securing measures in accordance with this Convention , technological development in the field of securing measures is fully accoun@@ ted for , and all efforts are made to ensure the optimum cost effectiveness and application of the principle of effective hed@@ ging of the flow of core material that is subject to this Convention securing measures , as far as current or future technology is enabled . &quot;
&quot; B ) To ensure optimal cost effectiveness , for example the following procedures are applied : I ) spatial finger@@ print as a means to define the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; concentration of follow @-@ up procedures on the phases of the fuel cycle , which could affect the production , processing , use and storage of core material , which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other core explosive materials , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To the effective implementation of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention is granted information on core material that is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the facilities necessary for the implementation of the securing measures in relation to this material of concern . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with the Convention .
&quot; II ) Information about systems are limited to the minimum level , which is necessary for the use of securing measures in relation to core material which is subject to the securing measures according to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) In the request of the Community , the organisation is prepared to test submission data that the community considers as particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organisation to become material , provided they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and the States to the nom@@ ination of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) Provi@@ de the Community either against a proposed denom@@ ination or at any time against a given designation , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative names . &quot;
&quot; if due to the repeated refusal of the Community , to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , the Council shall den@@ ote the refusal , after the General Director of the Organisation ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; the General Manager , &quot; ) , with the objective of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the concerned States undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually carry out the tasks facing them , according to their agreement . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up in such a way that i ) are as low as possible the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and dis@@ ruption of the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities below ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization is ensured with regard to confidential information .
&quot; every state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other civil servants , compl@@ ying with the relevant provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this agreement are concluded with regard to core material , when the community and the organization establish that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that is no longer usable or practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able for a nuclear activity which is under the viewpoint of securing measures . &quot;
&quot; according to the provisions of this Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the transfer of core material from the states that is subject to the securing measures pursuant to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures pursuant to this Convention shall be termin@@ ated in relation to core material as soon as the receiving state , as envis@@ aged in the Convention , has taken over responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the further core material . &quot;
&quot; if core material , the securing measures according to this agreement , shall be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the union agrees with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures according to this agreement can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive during the non @-@ application of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention .
B ) The organisation and the community meet a regulation that the securing measures planned in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used for such activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the provision shall be defined as long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures planned in this Convention are once again applied as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and the composition of this material in the state or the states in question , and about any passing on of such material from the state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their agreement as swi@@ f@@ tly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include a permit or a protected knowledge of the military activity and does not apply to the ensu@@ ing use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , however extraordinary expenses arising from a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as it prepar@@ es itself in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the cost of all additional measurements and sampling , required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or the state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the organization or the state due to damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , asser@@ ted that the implementation of the securing measures after this Convention is made , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council , after examination of the relevant information provided by the General Manager , declares that the organization has not been able to verify that no core material which must be subjected to this Convention , for nuclear weapons or other core explosive devices , it can also refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take the other measures planned there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been achieved by the applied assurance measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is affected - every opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organisation , the community or a state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the Community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute , an assessment of the Council according to Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council shall be settled by the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another by the Organization , the Community and the States , to submit to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who will pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organisation have not designated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the Community or the organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is to be applied if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding on the organisation , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ core states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention shall be concluded and &quot;
&quot; II . if the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is capable of applying its securing measures in relation to this State , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult each other at the request of one of the parties on a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all Member States of the Organization from any change of the Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organisation of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures for the entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; agreement &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol together .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure as required when carrying out the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the procedures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of the turno@@ ff of significant amounts of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a junc@@ ture by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; for the adequ@@ acy of the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal enc@@ ro@@ achment and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the material quantity is not specified for a specified period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified ranges . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out its veri@@ fications , the organization is making full use of the community safety system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance areas .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the community shall make use of the procedures and measures of the following ways and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee as to how they are determined more closely in the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , or otherwise from the existing core material and the stock of stock ; &quot;
B ) evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure to determine , review and evaluate differences in measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
e ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes of this stock , including the in- and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) Suppl@@ ements , which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures pursuant to this Agreement do not extend to materials used in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) If ur@@ anium or th@@ orium content , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is introduced into the States , the community of the organization divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is not implemented for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel @-@ created core material into the States , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the prerequis@@ ites mentioned in Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of core material , the securing measures according to this agreement is not possible or desirable , so the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the prerequis@@ ites mentioned in Article 13 , provided the organization and the community notice that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) Partic@@ ularly fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , provided that the entire material quantity freed from this article in the states is at no time any more than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment , which is less than 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold squar@@ ed of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should free core material along with core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to the Convention , shall be processed or stored , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which is necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective suppl@@ em@@ entation of the tasks of the Organisation in accordance with the Convention , in the individual as the procedures specified in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to force these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organization establishes a summar@@ ized inventory of the entire core material contained in the States , regardless of its origin , and carries on this inventory based on the following reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the EE@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action plan defined at the Conference on International Economic Co @-@ operation , to help address the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ age problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) The aim of the EEC and Member States , that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound by the Member States within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; d ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement , and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is inten@@ tional in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special action account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special action account ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special action account is run separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive deb@@ tors of the Member State , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the State concerned at order of the organization as administrator of the special action account and to deposit the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the application within 30 days after the entry into force of this Agreement or any other between the EEC and the administrator agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at any other time , agreed between the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may request payments before the above dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker is taking about proportional drag on the cash or the school &apos;s j@@ aws to cover the expenses for the special loans and to compens@@ ate for the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EW@@ G : &quot;
III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity for loan terms without compromise ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special loan loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is considered to be a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that apply to the purposes of the organization financed by the Organization . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special action account may not be used instead of prescribed means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved for a loan or loan programme that has already been approved by directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special withdraw@@ als are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions which are generally applicable to the organization of development loans granted by the organization ; thus , in the case of ten free @-@ years , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years . &quot;
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization which it re@@ tains .
&quot; each special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the income from each special loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made res@@ p . ( i ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and the according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted , may be recei@@ vers of a special commission . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred to the Member State as soon as possible , as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; until full awar@@ ding of all special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EE@@ G about the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and on the plans approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of withdrawal of the special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker keeps the EW@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special loan loan and the expenses there@@ for for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator transm@@ its the EE@@ G as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this statement . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the EW@@ G transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special action account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special action account , the amounts received from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the payments to the Member States are obvious . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the funds of the special action account , lead to a exchange of ideas on the status of the special action account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special action , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on December 31 , 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation if necessary , the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the entire amount of capital is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual member states and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of these procedures .
the General Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with an Not@@ i@@ fication on the proper authorisation of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is translated into two sig@@ natures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wor@@ ding is compulsory . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 is to be concluded between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE VER@@ OR@@ DN@@ ESS ER@@ LA@@ SS@@ EN : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental plant , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Joint Enterprise in Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research projects in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties to sum up their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and their respective research work that have acquired a higher priority due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement aims to enable each contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , resulting in the common objective of this research work , i.e. , by using controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom &apos;s Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Guides . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective collaboration , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or amended by the organs named in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; every time the parties accept a new program , this will take place in place of the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the agreement reached , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Par@@ agrap@@ h 1 of this Agreement , the contractual parties include an association agreement , which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the Joint Enterprise J@@ ET with the time of entry into force , its statutes are accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become a contract partner of any contract , with the exception of association contracts or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the bodies , which are commissioned with the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the association agreement fores@@ ees the implementation of a steering committee , which belongs to the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible outcomes in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; V@@ G . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is true in terms of all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and addresses their T * level in the interest of the two contractual parties to the common objective defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss agenda and the common objective defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world must be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities are asked . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Group , which provides the V@@ G research proposals with a view to providing the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom program , perceive this task as regards all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , will fulfill this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of personnel and for the exchange of the same between laboratories that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees assigned within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees , which offer the best possible use of the resources , staff as well as the knowledge and skills involved in conducting the Eur@@ atom program , are aware of this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research representative of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third state . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of future programs and the establishment of its overall comprehensive , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Gover@@ ning Committee , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the V@@ G on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel ex@@ chang@@ ers .
the representatives of the two parties act on the work of all technical advis@@ ing committees or of all administrative committees which will be created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is fixed annually to an amount that is at the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Switzerland , as well as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the common company as soon as it is established . &quot;

I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above .
agreement on the form of a change of correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States within the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks submit their respective application .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion billing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment of member states . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned , for whose application the BIS would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with every stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years passed . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as during the extension of the loan , the BIS would charge a loan order fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw should not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ Z , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take into account the funds of the Bank , expected to be three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BIS applied at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BIS has to proc@@ ure the required resources on the market itself , the interest rate could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin of the Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks make a suitable application . &quot;

in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
&quot; I hon@@ estly call upon the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or frozen lamb - , lamb - and goat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ asses body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the actual amount of annual quantity did not exceed the agreed amount and executed according to conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties agree with each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause , it is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the common market has not been touched by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a tes@@ tic@@ ular sentence of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account , pursuant to number 5 , the Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of the exhaus@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned below is set to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ body weight as part of Greece &apos;s accession to the community . &quot;
&quot; the Community sub@@ mits everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions in order that the sale of intervention stocks to frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other funding measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , are only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the world trade association with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a way that is compatible with the XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 code c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular , that , within the amounts specified in this agreement , it is granted export licenses for the products mentioned under number 1 . &quot;

&quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , &quot; &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures &quot; &quot; to free them from all other parties provided by the other parties in human origin from all entran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; considering that for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls into the jurisdiction of the community , which after the contract , by which it was founded , possesses the necessary powers ; &quot;
whereas Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention is required that the European Economic Community may become a contracting party of the Convention -
the Convention enters into force for the Community on the first day of the month following the signature .
&quot; it enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day at which the last of the parties has depos@@ ited their certificate of acceptance by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This additional protocol , however , occurs after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of two years after the date in force which it has been imposed upon , unless one of the contracting parties have notified a objection to its entry into force . &quot;
&quot; from that moment onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the member states of the Council of Europe , all the States and the European Economic Community , each adop@@ ting or objection in accordance with Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this Additional Protocol to Article 2 . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary General noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , notification or notification in connection with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; considering that it is highly desirable , if the Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group determination , &quot;
&quot; considering that this mutual support is only possible if the nature and use of these re@@ agents are subject to the provisions set by the Member States , and the necessary relief and exemp@@ tions for their import are granted - &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this Convention , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood group identification &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group identification and identification of blood @-@ intoler@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on Re@@ agents of Human Orig@@ in to the Deter@@ mination of the Convention on Re@@ agents of Human Orig@@ in , at the signature of this Convention or in the Sett@@ lement of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession certificate . &quot;

re@@ agents for blood group identification are provided to other parties only under the condition that no gain is associated with that they are used only for medical purposes and only be provided by the authorities designated by the participating governments .
each sending of re@@ agents to blood groups is a certificate to inf@@ lict them that they were made according to the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its system represent an administrative arrangement which may be amended or supplemented by the governments of the contracting parties .
the Parties shall take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents provided by other contracting parties for the determination of blood group determination from all entran@@ ts .
&quot; they also meet all necessary measures to ensure that these substances , referred to in Article 3 , proceed quickly and in the shortest possible way . &quot;
parties shall submit to each other via the Secretary General of the Council of Europe a list of places authorised to the exhibition of the certificate envis@@ aged in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with the positions designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the replacement of therapeutic substances of human origin .
&quot; this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe signing up ; they can be contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation or approval , or &quot;
&quot; this Convention enters into force one month after the day , at which three members of the Council have signed it according to Article 7 without prior approval or approval or have rati@@ fied or approved it . &quot;
&quot; for each member who signed this agreement later without prior approval or approval or rati@@ fied or approved , it enters into force a month after its signing or the approval of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate . &quot;
&quot; following entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe invites every non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot;
the Secretary General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the Advisory states ( a ) at the time of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied it without prior approval or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with respect to a period of one year by an ad to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; a re@@ agent for blood group identification must react with all tested blood samples , containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly dil@@ ution of the re@@ agent on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um dil@@ ution in which a reaction occurs ; dil@@ ution is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood cells in the overall volume .
&quot; anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a property carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group identification International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being worked out . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter observed in a series of dil@@ ution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te fer@@ ding .
the ti@@ ter indicates the dil@@ ution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group identification , for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain unchanged for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the feasi@@ bility trials ; it is appro@@ v@@ ingly approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container where they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penet@@ rate . &quot;
dry re@@ agent may not exceed 0.5 v.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested for more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours by further drying .
&quot; to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to yield the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group identification must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml cur@@ bing or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents destined for international exchange for blood group identification should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally dy@@ ed , at least as long as it is not until an international agreement has reached over a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group identification are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative con@@ tro@@ ll blood cells . &quot;
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has to carry out written records on all stages and controls of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
&quot; appropriate samples of all re@@ agents issued are to be kept from the laboratory for so long , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood groups can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups following the origin of their effective part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin exclusively contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to attach a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4 . the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of liquid needed for recovery &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or the label on the box where the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers are included : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; some &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on object carriers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are weak@@ ened in their own ser@@ um or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determination of the R@@ h group may be changed if International Standard Prepar@@ ations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 opposite C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or a corresponding counter@@ act against c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should react with blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for the use of slides in accordance with Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have been mixed with an equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent floo@@ ding of c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells at about 40 ° C within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
this ser@@ a is therefore specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are weak@@ ened in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 opposite C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D may contain ) , if they are mixed on a slide with equal amounts of 40 ° C within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals that are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 opposite C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form anti @-@ D may contain ) , if they are mixed on a slide with equal amounts of 40 ° C within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of Anti @-@ D with Anti @-@ C or Anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as the reaction conditions set by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all kinds of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be less than with the ant@@ an@@ ical antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances in group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; there is ag@@ glut@@ inated any human red blood cells that do not contain A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding agent , separated with in@@ undation of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on a property carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in any in@@ undation within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; there is ag@@ glut@@ inated any human red blood cells that do not contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding agent , with a bu@@ d of blood cells of group B to ti@@ tr@@ ate ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on a property carrier with equal amounts of a 5@@ - to 10 % splash of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ inous antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ inous antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ised by injection of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , so ag@@ glut@@ inated there are no in@@ anim@@ ate human red blood cells , in@@ different to which blood group they belong . &quot;

&quot; based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and the Member States of the Community as well as by the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984 , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fication of border form@@ alities and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; in the correction that the community has decided within the action programme to strengthen the internal market , from 1 January 1988 to introduce a unified management paper in the Community of goods transport , &quot;
&quot; in the correction that it is appropriate to simplify the iner@@ tia of goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a uniform management paper , &quot;
&quot; in the correction , that this agreement must not be interpreted in the way that it ent@@ ails the contractual parties from their obligations to other international conventions - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the handling of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular a holistic car@@ et@@ aker ( herein@@ after called Single @-@ Paper ) will be introduced , in particular a uniform car@@ et@@ aker ( herein@@ after referred to as the shipping method ) for all export and import procedures ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
the recei@@ v@@ ables associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are fu@@ elled by means of a single paper to apply for the prints in Anne@@ x I to the Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the single paper is used as an application or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - in order to carry out the legislation applicable in a contractual party , whose application would not be guaranteed with any use of the official documents ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the participants , so that they may apply for the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Agreement does not hin@@ der the contractual parties , simplified procedures , also using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Th@@ inking processes can be seen in particular that the goods in question are not at customs duty , and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; further , the delivery of an incomplete registration may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed with the approval of the competent authorities for a peri@@ odic gathering application , within the deadline specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use instead of a single paper trading paper . &quot;

&quot; ( 1 ) The registration shall be authorized in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , authorised by the country &apos;s competent authorities in which the authorities for the export or shipping shall be authorised . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country or country of country from the applicant or its representative in this country may require a translation of the registration to the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Differ@@ ent in paragraph 1 , the registration must always be carried out in one of the official languages of the import state if it is made in this country by other than that of the customs office of the export or access country submitted copy of the registration . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the registration sample for each individual proceeding of a goods traffic between the contracting parties , which may , if necessary , be added to the copies necessary to obtain the prob@@ abilities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; in the light of the special provisions on collection shipments , however , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the prob@@ es for export and shipping procedures can be performed on one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies intended for these bas@@ kets . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced , as far as possible , that the information contained in the copies of the application is contained in the individual proceedings . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of in@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries face each other on request , or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or rejected in full or in part , if the requested country of view is that the administrative assistance would interfere with its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests , or to viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its reason@@ ing for the seeking country shall be im@@ partial . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) In@@ dic@@ ates the customs authority of a country for administrative assistance , which could not afford it if it was requested , so it points out in its attempt on this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained in paragraph 1 must only be used for the purposes of this Convention and shall enjoy the protection , which the country &apos;s inner right of the country , which it has received , for information of this nature . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which has given them , and subject to the restrictions imposed by the Authority . &quot;

( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may use sub committees and work@@ groups that support him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee has the task of ad@@ minist@@ ering this Convention and ensuring its proper application .
&quot; for this purpose , the committee is regularly informed of the practical experience with the application of the Convention ; he proposes recommendations and in cases of paragraph 3 resolutions . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Committee shall decide on amendments to the App@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation referred to in Article 4 paragraph 3 of last thought line . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) Di@@ d the representative of a contracting party in the Mi@@ xed Committee have taken a decision under the retention of the provision of the constitutional requirements , the decision shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party meets appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this Convention , whereby the necessity must be taken into account that , as far as possible , to disman@@ tle the goods traffic and to apply the difficulties that are arising from the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Agreement shall apply to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand , as well as for the areas of EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;

&quot; each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement , subject to a twelve month deadline ; the written termination shall be addressed to the de@@ posit@@ ary referred to in Article 17 , which noti@@ fies it to all other contractual parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , provided that the contracting parties have depos@@ ited their acceptance documents to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities by 1 November 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Do not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , so it enters into force on the first day of the second month following the receipt of the last certificate of acceptance . &quot;

&quot; I allow myself to propose the following agreement , which will serve as the basis for co @-@ operation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research . &quot;
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , which is named &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; is called &quot; &quot; Council &quot; &quot; following the International Council for Marine Research , to ask recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will come as far as possible to this request . &quot;
&quot; 2 . bro@@ w the responsibility of the Commission in questions of management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to submit all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the inventory and the reports of its advisory committee of fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission are regularly consul@@ ted on how to intensi@@ fy the cooperation between the two parties , and in particular examine the opportunities it allows the Commission to establish a closer connection to the advice of the Council of F@@ ish@@ eries Committee . &quot;

&quot; the costs of meetings , which are conven@@ ed on special request by the Commission , are not included in the annual membership fee . &quot;
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties will be reviewed again . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement will be renewed on the basis of the existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
any party at any time has the car@@ el@@ essness to withdraw from the agreement in compliance with a one @-@ year period of notice .
&quot; with regard to clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognise the status of a scientifically qualified representative of the Commission at meetings of the Advisory Committee on F@@ ish@@ eries Management . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask the word and to participate in meetings , but would not have voting rights and also not the possibility of changing the agen@@ das of meetings . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would let me know if these agreements are acceptable as the basis of a cooperation between your council and the community .
