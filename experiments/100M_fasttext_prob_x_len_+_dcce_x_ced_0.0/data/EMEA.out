this document is a summary of the European Public Gui@@ deline Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the drug use .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have periods of abnormal disposition altern@@ ating periods of abnormal disposition . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy is used to treat severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased distur@@ ban@@ ces or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or melting tablets in patients with difficulty to swal@@ lowing pills . &quot;
&quot; patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are also ab@@ used as ab@@ ili@@ fy , should be adapted to the ab@@ ili@@ fy dose . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly used as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ ine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing her recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , was examined in three studies over to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered from un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence from 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with ab@@ ili@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo compared to a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was investigated by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution showed patients receiving ab@@ ili@@ fy doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety as the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , ab@@ ili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg of doses also decreased effectively as plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of ab@@ ili@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( continuous movement ) , trem@@ bling , nau@@ sea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were affecting the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes associated with the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ab@@ ili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for ab@@ ili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justi@@ fying this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transi@@ ent disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; when treated with ab@@ ili@@ fy patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including ab@@ ili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , there was a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including ab@@ ili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with ab@@ ili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ans , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicines with out@@ ward side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid @-@ blo@@ cker , decreases the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore , similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; among CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with ab@@ ili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore , similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be lifted to the c@@ anned height before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with ab@@ ili@@ fy can be calculated with an excessive increase in ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ sis concentrations .
&quot; doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data situation , and due to the concerns resulting in reproductive studies on animals , this drug may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
&quot; the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) : &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS increased 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS increased 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ i@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo when potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ a@@ emia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) are related to the side effects associated with anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma concentration . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors are medi@@ ated .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine d@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; at the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ depend@@ ant reduction of the binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study elements , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ sum@@ ption Rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , an significantly higher reduction of the return rate showed for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , representing 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study of weight gain was , in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . ) . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a preservation effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a biochem@@ ical or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mir@@ r@@ oring , the accompanying therapy showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached an re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prev@@ ailed against the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ gen@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ isation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination of poverty is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; one single dose study involving liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ state exposure to female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times of middle steam @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( 16 to 8 times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates found in human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were not more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study for more than 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the Middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors are medi@@ ated .
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached an re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prev@@ ailed against the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the melt tablets to ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic conditions and aff@@ ective disorders , reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscular rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;

the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for ab@@ ili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including ab@@ ili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with ab@@ ili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with ab@@ ili@@ fy can be calculated with an excessive increase in ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ sis concentrations .
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partially agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors are medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study of weight gain was , in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . ) . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo . &quot;

&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined as a result of the elimination of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the Middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used to quickly control Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle , under circum@@ v@@ enting adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used already for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine with ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets , ab@@ ili@@ fy melt tablets or ab@@ ili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with in@@ no@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( due to prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transi@@ ent disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscular sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ans , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after sole dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was applied as one @-@ time intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist is Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore , similar can @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be lifted to the c@@ anned height before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified in clinical trials with oral an@@ al@@ ges@@ ic Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS increased 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % were treated with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo when potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ a@@ emia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) are related to the side effects associated with anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of Agi@@ on / behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as her@@ edi@@ ty and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms with regard to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed mean improvement of the initial value at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe no@@ vice , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study elements , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sions Level , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , an significantly higher reduction of the return rate observed in 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study of weight gain was , in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . ) . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a biochem@@ ical or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mir@@ r@@ oring , the accompanying therapy showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of study in man@@ ic patients who had reached an re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself in the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after giving the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time was applied to the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated gift in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure that were 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore they have limited or no significance for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ rin@@ ds @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16 and 81 times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ anes ( in either dose or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ anes was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or at the beginning of the treatment low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ p@@ ic numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) established that Abra@@ x@@ anes in patients whose first treatment was no longer considered more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was and that , unlike other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel drugs , it has to be given with other medicines to decrease side @-@ effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ anes in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onies &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the abrasion of abrasion the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
&quot; at sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with impair@@ ments of the kidney function and there is currently no adequate data for recomm@@ ending dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on the safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ em@@ it@@ em@@ ulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel that could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment begins , and the patient must not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel once more . &quot;
&quot; in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ anes treatment cycles were to be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onic count rose again to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes .
&quot; while a clearly defined cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been detected , cardi@@ al incidents in the indicated patient lens are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease . &quot;
&quot; if patients suffer from nau@@ sea nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and kon@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ anes should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable feeding method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ anes .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes are advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child witnesses . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised before the treatment via a sperm count , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ anes is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ anes can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can impact on the transport and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; the following are the most common and most important cases of side @-@ effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ anes in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed with 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ anes as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes the co@@ iling of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular Indi@@ m@@ eren and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ il@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel by the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ anes for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two unanim@@ ous un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel for 3 weeks , either in form of solvent @-@ containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % for metastatic disease and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ anes after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the complete p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ anes with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml as analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Acc@@ ep@@ ted to intraven@@ ous m@@ amma @-@ based regim@@ en in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took place in the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma centr@@ ation in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or wheat binding of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel Clear@@ ance was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ aboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ anes in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participate in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability has been detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic drug and as with other potentially toxic substances it should be treated with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution . &quot;
&quot; after complete addition of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good adhes@@ ion to the solid material . &quot;
&quot; then the pier@@ cing bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itations or sm@@ ells are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must be gently inver@@ ted to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before applying . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding quantity of the re@@ constitu@@ ed Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC inf@@ usion bag . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for the public transport must ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 and presented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the marketing application , is set up and works before and while the drug is put into circulation . &quot;
&quot; risk management plan The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market is oblig@@ ated to carry out the trials and further pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities described in the Phar@@ mac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) and all subsequent updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline on risk management systems for drugs , the updated R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP must be submitted • If new information could affect the current safety specification , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk management activities • Wi@@ thin 60 days after reaching an important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • On request of the E@@ MEA &quot;

&quot; using Abra@@ x@@ anes with other medicines Please inform the doctor if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs , since these might possibly have an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ anes . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable feeding method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ anes .
&quot; in addition , they should be advised before the treatment via a sperm conservation , since the use of the Abra@@ x@@ anes treatment is the possibility of lasting in@@ fertility . &quot;
abra@@ sive and abrasion of machines Abra@@ x@@ anes can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can impact on the transport and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; if you also receive other medicines in the context of your treatment , you should consult with regard to driving or serving machines from your doctor . &quot;

&quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in the pier@@ cing bottle up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) , when it is stored in the cart@@ on to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; • After the re@@ constitution , each ml of the Sus@@ pension contains 5 mg p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ ous solution from humans ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph.@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for preparation and application Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and as well as with other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should slowly be inj@@ ected over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle .
&quot; then swi@@ vel and / or inver@@ t the pier@@ cing bottle for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ t , until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;

par@@ enter@@ al drugs should be subjected to possible particles and disc@@ ol@@ or@@ ations prior to applying a visual inspection when the solution or container should always permit this .
&quot; stable un@@ opened pier@@ cing bottles with Abra@@ x@@ ane are stable up to the date specified on the packaging , when the pier@@ cing bottle is stored in the cart@@ on to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; after the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should immediately be filled into an inf@@ usion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the holders of the authorisation for the in@@ tranet prior to market launch are provided by the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training Bro@@ ch@@ ure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing instruction . • With clear imaging of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for the transport by the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ s@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ blood values , in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ s@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
Ab@@ s@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ or .
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it conduc@@ ts to the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ s@@ amed was treated as injection into a v@@ ein as part of a study with 4@@ 79 patients , which suffered an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected in a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ s@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of stre@@ amed Ab@@ s@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from a an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ s@@ amed were kept to the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ s@@ amed may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ s@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce medicines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with scheduled major operational interventions ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ s@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
&quot; HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme . &quot;
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical course and disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient over or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week via intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms associated with symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical course and disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ tes number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , is an indication of the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serves is required , Ab@@ s@@ amed should receive a weight of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the operative procedure . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme - large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Ab@@ s@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be presented pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ op@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ s@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ .org ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous disease ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure are contra@@ indicated by ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial oc@@ clusi@@ on , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ tis or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a recent cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA after mon@@ otherapy of sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden active loss defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ f@@ usions , the recur@@ rence rate should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ un toxic@@ ation , infections or hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , decreases ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / mic@@ rol@@ iter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are identified , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be assessed and an examination of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous usage of Ab@@ s@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentrations should not be exceeded with maintenance therapy under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for severe cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ated agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have demonstrated no significant benefit based on ep@@ ox@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration needed to control an@@ emia symptoms and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ti@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded with maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is not accelerated in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients that need to be trans@@ co@@ ded ) . &quot;
&quot; if the h@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a half @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the objective of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure , if possible , prior to the onset of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial treatment potential of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ o@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy had been returned if a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
in vitro studies on tumor tissues do not result in an interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
&quot; over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( brain bleeding , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retin@@ al thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ors lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the gene@@ tically recovered ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and in proportion to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate percentage identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ o@@ blast@@ omas ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ ome , 144 Non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ blast@@ omas ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 M@@ amm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and patient control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ clari@@ fied , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than with the controls performed with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and at controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients were included with these characteristics in the verified data . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa conditions after repeated intraven@@ ous application demonstrated a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s ser@@ um mirror is much lower than the ser@@ um mirror obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um mirrors remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In veter@@ inary studies with approxim@@ ate 20 times of the recommended weekly dose , ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ em body weight , to a del@@ aying of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in the mort@@ ality rate . &quot;
&quot; these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of in@@ secure significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ s@@ amed for a period of maximum 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so that if necessary , particle sizing is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ s@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the previously mentioned indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range , which res@@ ides back in further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be considered and treated with Ab@@ s@@ amed at the beginning of the therapy . &quot;

&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oma , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ s@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ s@@ amed must be given through injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for a an@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value might be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or rising potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ s@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood flow with Ab@@ s@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated by the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa administration and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ s@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood @-@ growing ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cul@@ ars , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous disease or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lic ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ s@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is ahead , the cause of your an@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ s@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines / apply it recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ s@@ amed , your doctor may appropriate certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means for building up the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood flow ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ s@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ama is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that breaks the bones ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture than with the inf@@ in ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ama can reduce the symptoms occurring within the three days after the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ama may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ era is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined by the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ama was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood once more norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study of older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ama ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ama had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of A@@ cl@@ era &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ eric may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other component . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in A@@ cl@@ era are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( die @-@ dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ama &apos;s manufacturer provides educational materials for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ein for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains hints as to how the medicine is to be used , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ama is recommended two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ama should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the addition of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular Vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ era inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ama can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after applying A@@ cl@@ eric .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ama are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 as data on the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cl@@ ama is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for this patient population . &quot;
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ ama before the start of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ama by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the addition of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene , should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental attacks , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ och@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after A@@ cl@@ era &apos;s administration can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the frequency of cases reported as serious side effects of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ eric ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of receiving was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels observed below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were treated in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ein in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ein in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently acquired hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ illary area occ@@ ured , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ och@@ on@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in one patient treated with A@@ cl@@ ein and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained by the addition of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ ein 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy existing ver@@ teb@@ ral body ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ver@@ teb@@ rate correction .
effects on morph@@ ometric bone frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta reduced significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new fluid structures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ama @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of disability frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effect on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed an equally consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of bone frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h radius by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vis a year after the third annual dose of oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ eric ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cl@@ ama treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment increased the BM@@ D at all times and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all times .
&quot; in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment , the A@@ cl@@ ama treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total , and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ein @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 study ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moder@@ ately severe disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2 @-@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed in comparison with the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ein and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as resp@@ onder@@ s at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 patients with A@@ cl@@ ama versus 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma gas rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the peak value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ mination phase with a terminal elimination of the elimination of ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption of the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease in the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
a reduced clearance of substances with cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , hydrogen @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min at the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even kidney function interference down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; because of severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was given ; a 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg was administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were performed in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ or of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
at rats one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was 0.1 mg / kg due to lower ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;

Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of the authorisation for the public transport under@@ takes to carry out the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance that are presented in the Phar@@ mak@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the adopted version 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the application for authorisation and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by CH@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for drug products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk ination ) has been reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a sub@@ class of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the disease Pa@@ get the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta acts as it re@@ alizes the bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and thereby rein@@ forces the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ ein with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines / apply it recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ eric together with food and drink , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take enough fluids before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ eric . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you recently broke the hips , it is recommended to make A@@ cl@@ eric &apos;s administration two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ama works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or more . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ama can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ cl@@ era &apos;s administration is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before ending therapy with A@@ cl@@ ama If you are considering ending treatment with A@@ cl@@ ama , please notice your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects in connection with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; at present it is uncle@@ ar whether A@@ cl@@ ama causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have obtained A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or critical or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are neg@@ atively affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ein recommends two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after A@@ cl@@ era &apos;s administration , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular Vitamin D is recommended prior to the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , studies on the attitude of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can result in a small minority of patients suicide . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive diseases or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - aside from obesity - have no noticeable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
&quot; relatives or other nearby persons ) are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms , and immediately take medical advice if these symptoms occur . &quot;
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were completed by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .
&quot; Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , Johannis@@ kr@@ aut , has not been studied , is assumed that the simultaneous administration of potent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma centri@@ city of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . &quot;

&quot; after 2 years , the difference in weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
9 weight reduction and other risk factors In trials in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with
&quot; in Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % . &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 on plac@@ ebo I &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight in weight between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3,@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; after 13 days , the Ste@@ ady @-@ State plasma bars were reached ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1.6 ± 14.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; food influence : in the case of food intake , it showed a 67 % increased C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C in the case of food intake . &quot;
patients with black skin colour can have up to 31 % smaller C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and one by 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but observed in animals after exposure in the human@@ oid field , were considered potentially relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress seems to be associated with the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure to the ri@@ fl@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation does not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Gui@@ deline Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the conducted studies to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which can be adjusted not satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , causing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced when using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl ure@@ a in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , reported a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , when met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and when met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated levels of liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be monitored again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ sion@@ al symptoms , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment continues with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be guided by the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can ag@@ itate from fat deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a consequence of a hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) appeared . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.1 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral tw@@ o- or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin , is the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported as a wor@@ sen@@ ing or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but failing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women , treated with a comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes or occurs during pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal reduces and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ fr@@ active index of the lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents above the triple of the upper limit of the standard range also frequently appear similar to plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the incidence of severe heart failure in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ p .
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients were performed in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a medicine . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occ@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fatty and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the start of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months optimization phase with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.45 % , compared to patients receiving insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosing in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the output values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ etics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced the overall plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diab@@ etic and cardiovascular treatment either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occ@@ ured in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal reduces and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder epithel@@ ium . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased incidence of color@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women , treated with a comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical studies more than 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both over an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the target regarding its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ arization and vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular disease risks associated with taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medicine showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in some patients with long @-@ term type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and heart disease or earlier stroke , which were treated with Ac@@ tos and insulin , a heart failure developed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , in which pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was compared with other oral anti@@ diab@@ etics or plac@@ ebo ( non @-@ drug @-@ free tablets ) , women ( but not in men ) showed a higher number of frac@@ tures . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ hor@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ hor@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ eg@@ els , indicating that blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ hor@@ ane should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ hor@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Human Use Committee ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ hor@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly through an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding thickness , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi @-@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ hor@@ ane in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , where hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which pass over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may result in such journeys that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape items , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Diff@@ ic@@ ult hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help person or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration amounts up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule have been considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ of reproduction , pre@@ clinical data cannot be detected any special haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane is extracted from the fridge , to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ cit@@ ated according to the instructions for the first use . &quot;
&quot; some patients , where hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;

&quot; in addition , Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id doses may also be adapted when applied together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin acting rapidly must be raised , subsequently the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which pass over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may result in such journeys that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients that already exhibit signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out knots ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine crystalline deposits which can lead to joint and bone damages ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic at least during the first six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant because it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do medication ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who received 120 mg once a day , with the last three measurements a urine acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver levels . &quot;
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia associated with diseases that have already resulted in deposits of urine ( including one from the patient &apos;s history or current gyp@@ sy node and / or a arthritis attack ) .
&quot; if the acid @-@ acid levels remain still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function limits , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since childhood and adol@@ escence there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; as an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant receiver has no experience in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensation , treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other resin @-@ based medicines , it can occur during the course of the treatment , because by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ age pi@@ eg@@ els , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far reaching that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease : during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function before the beginning of the treatment and in the further course , according to clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was not performed in beta @-@ carot@@ ene studies , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line met@@ aboli@@ zation was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; subjects were associated with simultaneous administration of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times a day with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ s ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously used other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x measured a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , the intake of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delay and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not close to the side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ O@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall fin@@ er group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined by these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cler@@ ical disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensation con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups altogether more than once were listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 4 years long with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies phase 3 for these cans either at all or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin disc@@ ol@@ oration , skin les@@ ion , male in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in the concentration of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te , decrease the number of white blood cells . &quot;
active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolic disease in humans and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is a potent , not pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month certain ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.00@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the ser@@ um acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
509 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function limits The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage decline in ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the phase 3 extension study showed that the permanent decrease in the ser@@ um acid levels yiel@@ ded up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed no treatment against a postpon@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the cast , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the layer no@@ des by month 24 . &quot;
elevated T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased from mono and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um acid concentration , provided that was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma activation of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro @-@ som@@ ites , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ selected Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ modified Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ates ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the middle total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function limits After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function limits the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multi@@ pl@@ ers of oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In males rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately the 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and Ur@@ ine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it has been noted that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about the 4.3 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by lowering the upward capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which are about 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously used other active ingredient .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 4 years long with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month certain ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the phase 3 extension study showed that the permanent decrease in the ser@@ um acid levels yiel@@ ded up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed no treatment against a postpon@@ ement . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , in which a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists . &quot;
&quot; the patient must use the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also submitted data to indicate that the al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose , which is needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , rebel@@ li@@ ous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sau@@ res . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other component . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used for diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission presented the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to white white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , only be given with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by os@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required a hospital brief@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore alert attention to any signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to en@@ force pain in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rare , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy group administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , which indicate whether to use a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet in the next morning during the failure of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ ending ron@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in clinical trials was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither applied during pregnancy nor of breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , decreases in ser@@ um calcium up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar incidence . &quot;
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate sequ@@ encing of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ Tronic D3 is the increase in the intestinal res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on fem@@ ur h@@ als and 7.8 % at the drop @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with the plac@@ ebo group , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 3.2 % compared with plac@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily donation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption Acc@@ ording to an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the medi@@ an organic bio@@ availability of women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast . &quot;
bio@@ availability increased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats show that al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is distributed temporarily in tissue @-@ tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion In addition to a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate about 50 % of radio@@ active substances were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ partments .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous formulation of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that the secre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems in humans . &quot;

the average maximum concentration in ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum level of ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ lic in the liver and then is met@@ aboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ Tronic D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form , met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; elimination of radio@@ active @-@ marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was the mean separation of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2,4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nonetheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly higher cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

advoc@@ acy is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , with the use of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which transplan@@ tation was rejected after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant , and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; trem@@ or ( trem@@ or ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diabetes , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension , and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors need to be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medicine taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange jel@@ ly capsules , printed in red ink on the bri@@ ghtest yellow chap@@ sel@@ top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close control of a physician experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) .
&quot; following conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us panel should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both ni@@ er@@ e- and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations - ren@@ al transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change during the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the tran@@ spl@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted a tran@@ spl@@ ant receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) based on the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation after a transition from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day must begin treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection .
&quot; in adult patients who are converted to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , although there are no clinical experience with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , occ@@ ured patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the target area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potentials of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um incre@@ mental levels , a calculation of the in@@ in@@ atal levels and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases when using whole blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ seb@@ um of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dose adjustment , modifications of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may take several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the seb@@ um in blood 20 n@@ g / ml will not exceed .
&quot; in clinical practice , the seb@@ um of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually found in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation recei@@ vers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close control of a physician experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , which proved to be more resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection in adult heart transplan@@ tation recei@@ vers and tran@@ spl@@ ant recei@@ vers in childhood age , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions that can lead to a degradation of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ trophy , called cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , was observed in rare cases , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid pollution and est@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , treat special caution in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , thus increasing or lowering the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is advisable to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level with the con@@ current dose of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ Antibiot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal transit . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used for acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone ex@@ positions , precau@@ tionary measures are especially cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ value .
the results of a low number of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of the pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on potential adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not precisely determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects are performed in descending order in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; as is known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , as is known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) is often increased . &quot;
&quot; cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive , multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms , including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sed . &quot;
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ine protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ depend@@ ant inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on T cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ as , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 patient transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients , who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation , and in 630 cases after an intestinal tran@@ spl@@ ant , were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f revealed in these published studies the observations in large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for hep@@ atic , ren@@ al and heart transplan@@ tation to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entr@@ al study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less frequent in the first year following the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases were found to develop a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients being converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of the gen@@ esis of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multic@@ entr@@ al study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients , which at the same time under@@ went pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after col@@ on transplan@@ tation showed 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates for the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack , which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , Adv@@ oc@@ ate &apos;s effectiveness in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of advoc@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advances may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the transport of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , on the place and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections are recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life periods . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII should not be reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to verify an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the Factor VIII treatment is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dosing speed should be directed to the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation has no experience . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients experiencing higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected decl@@ ining of the blood co@@ ag@@ ion factor VIII was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory with A@@ DV@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ des against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a continued peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred that pointed to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported on hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VIII works as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( bas@@ eline value of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since its initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as a positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , to apply for another extension procedure within 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; usually , however , the breast , brain , bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) is affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; A@@ deno@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and therefore can not trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to restore damaged DNA and to kill cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the abdom@@ en , the bones and the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions posed to him , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on examining the submitted papers , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ours brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the kind of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is immediately released , and the other is slowly released for a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen caused inflammation of the nose @-@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be re@@ trac@@ ted to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all h@@ ay fever symptoms , except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ aze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients below Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , including adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ on@@ aze may also not be used in patients suffering from con@@ genital glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to appro@@ ve the transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( that is , without crus@@ hing or ch@@ ew@@ ing it ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in children under the age of 12 . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since long @-@ term application may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after the termination of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ung@@ ur@@ id , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a s@@ wollen r@@ hin@@ ic@@ um ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ oline etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data is insufficient to prono@@ unce appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data do not suff@@ ice to prono@@ unce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients need to be informed that treating hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck stru@@ t or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , Aer@@ in@@ aze is canc@@ eled as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma center of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and is neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies have no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ aded , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce attempts . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult mi@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory suff@@ oc@@ ation , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ dial pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as as@@ trop@@ ine typical symptoms ( m@@ alo@@ d@@ rought , pup@@ illary tube and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include blocking the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hili@@ a as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flu@@ idity , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aero@@ bic pills showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes of the administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the all@@ uring donation of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognize any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its single components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , body &apos;s own substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze tablets rel@@ ieve symptoms occurring in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose , or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; inform your doctor if with you under the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed : • B@@ loo@@ d@@ stroke pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nau@@ sea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you use Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; in case of application in recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ aze leads to ligh@@ the@@ aded or lowers the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should check immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ aze If you have forgotten to take a dose on time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have greatly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information @-@ information .

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing not , whist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin failures have been reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , in@@ som@@ nia , loss of physical activity , cases of liver inflammation , and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous cir@@ rho@@ sis was also very rarely reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to take ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 m@@ g. a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in case of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients , who had also as@@ thma ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptoms score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptom relief after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe to appro@@ ve the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be termin@@ ated after the onset of symptoms and can be resum@@ ed in their re@@ occurring .
in case of persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended a continual treatment during the allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and Al@@ co@@ hol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ aded , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was head@@ ache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times a clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hili@@ a as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin had been administered at a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight slides , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire about the quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of eti@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
&quot; since the hi@@ stam@@ ine release is a caus@@ al factor in all age @-@ specific diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will also lead to an improvement of the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ od@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching for more than 50 % was observed with 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients were comparable to the overall seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
the pre@@ clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated offering , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ st@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognize any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of infectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years can met@@ aboli@@ ze the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and experience higher substance loads ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children from 2 to 11 years , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sac@@ char@@ sis and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times a clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ oric . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced power loss nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire about quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ od@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis which are restricted to the restriction .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredients after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is available in type III bottle bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate is taken to remove without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side @-@ effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times a clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interim data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin had been applied at a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight slides , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire about the quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients were comparable to the overall seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is taken out without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablets for the treatment of children under 6 years have not yet been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not turn significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the inser@@ tion formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;

&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose therapy studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dose for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; the safety of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ char@@ ase I@@ som@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group .
&quot; inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended dose , plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable to the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us solution for admission is indicated for children between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included . &quot;
&quot; if the solution for inser@@ ting an application sy@@ ringe for intake with sc@@ aling is attached , you can alternatively use them to take the appropriate amount of solution to take . &quot;
&quot; regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which you suffer and will then determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution . &quot;
&quot; however , in children under 2 years diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia common side effects during adults fatigue , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness and head@@ aches more often reported as plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; 97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for mounting is available in bottles with a child @-@ safe cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe suitable for use with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml@@ - and 5 ml cans .
June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company withdraw@@ s its application for approval for the transportation of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to person , because humans have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; physically alien &quot; &quot; and trains antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus of this stam@@ m of rapid antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane &apos;s membrane man@@ ure with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body det@@ ects as a body @-@ alien ) was removed , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; Good Clinical Practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ is is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ acy should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drug the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ generation is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , as@@ generative medicine reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; however , AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , but can also delay the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ate@@ was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; using low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was compared to 206 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ acy was less effective than ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , au@@ gen@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few contacted the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicines increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a greater decrease in viral load together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ thma ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ is may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; an@@ hydr@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded as well as are degra@@ dable and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , in patients who are taking au@@ gen@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ate@@ is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ is in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ acy was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ acy in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
usually A@@ gener@@ acy capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generation capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dosage for as@@ generative capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If au@@ ral capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of as@@ hydr@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ generative capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of an@@ hydr@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ate@@ is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ acy capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ hydr@@ ase may not be given at the same time with pharmaceuticals , which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ or or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ her@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ acy capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal consequences .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral hepatitis B or C treatment , please read the relevant specialist information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with hep@@ atic hep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate increased incidence of liver dysfunction in an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of as@@ car@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ idal effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depend on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ her@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active ingredients are available . &quot;
patients who take these medicines at the same time may be less effective for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s reduced plasma level ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored for over@@ dose symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ine content of the A@@ gener@@ acy solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ is should be de@@ composed in duration 5 , if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which treatment medications were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders , associated . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width are not allowed at the same time with pharmaceuticals which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width an@@ hydr@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to higher plasma levels with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate the lowered plasma bars by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already present Johannis@@ kr@@ aut , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and , if possible , verify the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , proving efficacy and safety of this treatment plan . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close supervision is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ o in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the viol@@ ative component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of dan@@ os@@ in and au@@ gen@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in the case of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may reduce the power concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mon level . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available for this purpose . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with an@@ hydr@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could increase the plasma level of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially lead to interactions between them . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with an@@ hydr@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ acy , since it can lead to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
&quot; simultaneous intake with an@@ hydr@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentration and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in related side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma mark@@ ers increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ idal effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabol@@ isation is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect pronounced increases in the plasma level during simultaneous administration of au@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while applying am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ is may not be used together with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while the simultaneous use of an@@ hydr@@ ase is treated with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma @-@ level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for over@@ dose symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dosage is to be adjusted when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ generative , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternate methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of l@@ act@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r goes over to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the entry into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the further development of the descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
A@@ gener@@ acy &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most adverse events associated with as@@ generative treatment were mild to moderate , and appeared early and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of as@@ generative medicine or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects originate from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg a@@ generation twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medicine , and performed with more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull@@ ring ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients below ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching , and occurred spontan@@ eously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontan@@ eously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg a@@ generation twice a day together with low dos@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , the species and frequency of adverse events ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received as@@ generative medicine along with low dose of de@@ hydr@@ ated rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures to initiate . &quot;

&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage became - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 weeks , whereby 14 isol@@ ates were gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients , showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 80@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M combined with a reduced phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for ass@@ essing the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates can be applied .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ ind@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ators ) , in@@ ind@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ ind@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ ind@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , seem to provoke ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of as@@ hydr@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , combined with PI pre@@ treated adults to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 600 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ e- and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generation ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average fluctu@@ ation of the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ inter@@ sti@@ tial threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ble@@ ached an@@ hydr@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 was previously treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , as@@ generative solution for inser@@ ting and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg was three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ generation .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , therapy optimisation should be taken into account in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ble@@ ed &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of intake was affected by the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the dosing intervals depends on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when they are given at the same time with a@@ generation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of as@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposition as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , as@@ generative solution and as@@ generative capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be small . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma bricks comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , who correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily donation of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ ome of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both clinical studies and therapeutic use , gave little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical routine by means of AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients during clinical studies , neither during the administration of au@@ gen@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high level of mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition that was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes observed that indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If au@@ ral capsules are used without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of as@@ hydr@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ generative capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active ingredients are available . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ acy should be set to 27 if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
508 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close supervision is recommended as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ generative , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % res@@ p .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the entry into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ acy &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures to initiate . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , therapy optimisation should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ble@@ ed &quot; au@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during the dosing intervals depending on the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when they are given at the same time with a@@ generation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , who correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ ome of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings was revealed . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high level of mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that the metabol@@ isation path@@ ways are not fully mature in young , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generation capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dosage for as@@ generative medicine is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as no dosage recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of as@@ generative solution for inhal@@ ing and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ generative medicine is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reactions as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ o@@ col@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ acy is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ or or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ her@@ ase does not prevent risk 47 from transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of acute ker@@ at@@ oses , it is applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; the cream is thin layer on the skin surface before bed@@ time , so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks , either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p for immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can continue as long until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es have van@@ ished in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the les@@ ions treated are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces infected skin area , until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with one for circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ kers were observed . &quot;
&quot; in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which have required a treatment and / or have caused a temporary bodily impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous sur@@ geri@@ es for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es in the genital and per@@ ic@@ al@@ tic area , no clinical experiences have yet been found . &quot;
&quot; limited data may indicate an increased rate of slope loss reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has demonstrated a lesser efficacy in this group of patients with regard to eradi@@ c@@ ating the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair @-@ attachment has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions increases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since no data is available for long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , so the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower likel@@ ihood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for treating ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses at anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support effectiveness in this purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after de@@ compos@@ ing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin interactions cause a lot of dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions reported less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not result in direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither mal@@ le@@ able nor after repeated top@@ ical application , quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been reached , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently shared and probably or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the place of treatment of the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include dis@@ comfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ al patients treated by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III have been shown below .
the most common ones than likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to this study were a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects specified by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III trials with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
&quot; this according to the assessment plan presented the clinical signs indicates that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three weeks weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , exc@@ ori@@ ation / fl@@ yers ( 23 % ) and o@@ est@@ rogen ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , this assessment of clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe ear@@ ache and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ose al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 sach@@ ets , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in three phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients , the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients versus 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for three weeks of use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ ired scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ i ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a creme was examined in four random@@ ized , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) or .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week use during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fi@@ able bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study of der@@ mal application had no similar effects during the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ inous , there is a risk for humans due to systemic exposure as very low . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ours appeared in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements ag@@ grav@@ ate , decreased lung volume , cardiac and eye disease . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with revi@@ e@@ wers , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by focusing on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , stomach pain , r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion station . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a meas@@ ur@@ es@@ ize of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be well @-@ known , and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. permission for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with backed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified and for these patients no dosage intake can be recommended .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been identified , and no dosage intake can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience concerning the resum@@ ption of treatment after a prolonged break , the risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious following the theore@@ tically increased risk of the treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the onset of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate at which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are dropped , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate at which the preceding reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no new@@ born data exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to stop breast@@ feeding with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions observed in 53 % of patients during the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; undes@@ irable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are performed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe complic@@ ation and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment started , with a more severe complic@@ ation in the patients aged 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , there were no antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , including 3 patients in which it never occurred to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in the urine , while in patients with high antibody manufacturers a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was detected . &quot;
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions coinci@@ dentally coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restore of enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to improve lung function in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group as from the following table .
the decrease in contrac@@ tion contrac@@ tion FE@@ V is clin@@ ically non @-@ significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous manifest@@ ations of patients treated by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant trans@@ fusion seg@@ reg@@ ated across five mode of efficacy was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe displacement and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag@@ ag@@ int in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in case of multiple patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of displacement ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe dis@@ continued form were limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schem@@ ata were conducted on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute ga@@ it test . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ si@@ ties is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , assessed annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated giving and reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data do not recognize any special haz@@ ards for the human being . &quot;
&quot; since no case studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed below 6 . 6 . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the permit for the in@@ verter has to complete the following program of studies , whose findings form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk relationship . &quot;
&quot; this register will receive longer @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction occurred on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or taken recently , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
indications for handling - dil@@ ution and application The concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can gradually be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( incidence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nau@@ sea • abdominal pain • P@@ ain pain • R@@ ain pain • R@@ ain pain • R@@ ain pain • R@@ ain pain • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the inf@@ usion station
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that will be available , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the dil@@ ution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on body weight of each patient first the number of di@@ lu@@ ent blood samples .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; &quot; non @-@ small &quot; &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies , used as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should have cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the addition of cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic drug &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of liquid ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood is changed or in which certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed therefore s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells from sharing . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin showed an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.6 months at doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival than with the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission requested the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each soap dispens@@ er has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dosage of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after conclusion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell @-@ cell carcin@@ oma the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ ric , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ ry , a full blood picture should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine drink ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood vessel or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria are based on the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 Blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before the treatment . &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 doses of dose a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that patients aged 65 years old or over 65 years of age have an increased side effect risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min have no dose adjustment necessary to go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ ic values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for the existence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ ital status and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients , before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ tes again have a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cycles have once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ magnetic count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te speed and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ a@@ der@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been be@@ et@@ ted if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed need to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - l@@ actic measure to reduce the related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients receiving treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 heavy cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated living substances ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity exists through p@@ emet@@ re@@ al , men should be pointed out before the treatment procedure to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) , and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in increased breakdown of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage . &quot;

the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ ric Mi@@ xed in pregnant women , but as for an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed may not be used during pregnancy , except if it is imperative and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the reproductive capacity exists through p@@ emet@@ re@@ al , men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the lock @-@ up service . &quot;

&quot; in clinical studies , cases of inter@@ sti@@ tial inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were occasionally reported in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
cases of acute kidney failure occurred in p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agents ( see section 4.4 ) .

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ tor@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ li@@ y @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ as tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the difference between the two treatment arms resulted from an improvement in lung function parameters in ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , open Phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival was in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( n = 172 , 6.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data of a separate random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study indicate that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment is similar to doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ balance of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in line with hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = interval ; IT@@ T = int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fusion ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed according to the dose as a mono@@ clinic were examined at 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses of 0,2 up to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion zones over a period of 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the dose will be returned within 24 hours after the application , unchanged in the urine . &quot;
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ value in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

&quot; as weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients receiving a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic must be adapted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional pregn@@ ancies , in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bars was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; following the administration of a dispos@@ able dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers were observed at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side effects observed after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ defined size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to inhi@@ bitions regarding possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered three times a day , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
based on tests on humans and animals can be prec@@ eded by a quick atro@@ phy of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect sets in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of ga@@ str@@ an and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , high @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight vis @-@ à @-@ vis the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight during study course ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the weight loss occ@@ ured in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value of 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value of 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
waist circum@@ ference was the mean change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study of obes@@ e patients to which the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose was administered , two primary metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine group ) were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the overall plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be recognized as a special threat to humans . &quot;

&quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and , if you take medicines for high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; as you can define your cal@@ ory and fat limits , please refer to other helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or contain a meal no fat , do not take any capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in combination with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional needs ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , start your first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; food hand@@ books are effective , as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; • Take fat @-@ free , in order to decrease the likel@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before starting with taking the capsules . &quot;

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and thereby develop that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the treatment begins , since at this time the fat percentage in the diet may not have been consistently reduced . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional percep@@ tions : start a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a high @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood you will exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; do not waste the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fet@@ ched main dish or a durable one , as you possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • Blood pressure • stroke • Cer@@ tain canc@@ ers • Cer@@ tain cancer diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find speci@@ fying on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
note the table below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; what quantity is suitable for you , refer to the information below which indicates the number of calories you are suitable for . • Re@@ duction of the mode of operation of the capsule is decisive for adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week of weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
&quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and also adhere to it . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional book containing information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ x@@ i is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ ic@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ x@@ i can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug used as an anti@@ em@@ etic agent ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the gut . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ x@@ i was studied in three major studies at 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of chemotherapy , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ x@@ i showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared with 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ x@@ i in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ x@@ i ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission awarded the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for placing Alo@@ x@@ i in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ x@@ i is indicated : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy on the basis of cancer and for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ x@@ i for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thickness of the col@@ on , patients should be closely monitored with am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable while receiving pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- Inter@@ v@@ all is extended or who tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with chemotherapy for chemotherapy , Alo@@ x@@ i should not be used in the days following chemotherapy or to treat nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics examined against tum@@ ors ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ din , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies were the most common side effects observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with Alo@@ x@@ i , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dos@@ ages , similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ activity relationships to be observed . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies conducted , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an alo@@ e over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7,@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study showed a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ ato@@ gene chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine , as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g. pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given to patients who were given intraven@@ ously 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the E@@ KG effects of previously administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption Acc@@ ording to intraven@@ ous formulation follows an initial decrease in plasma concentration a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , 5 measured middle ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the equivalent of one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the introduction of 0.75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt injection in gest@@ ures , the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver function disorder the terminal elimination intensity and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure , which are regarded as sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which suggests a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre@@ clinical trials , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats but not mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ x@@ i is a unique application in humans , the relevance of these results is very low for humans . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the dispens@@ ation of approval for the traff@@ icking of hepatitis C prescribed drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml Inj@@ ection Solution was recommended . &quot;
&quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ eon should be similar to a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug products &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long persistent ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination the liver tissue damage occurs , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are significantly increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effect , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s efficacy was compared to the efficacy of the reference doctor to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment were treated to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided by CH@@ MP to fail the approval for placing on the market ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed may not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C that responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ard@@ ated more patients than with the reference drug . Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test used in the study was to examine the question to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body trains antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( fis@@ sur@@ es or cuts ) , scrat@@ ching and stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ ar@@ go might not be effective against this kind of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells where proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients on plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were examined at skin findings , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ med cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused to be demonstr@@ ably or possibly caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go prev@@ ailed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , scrat@@ ching or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; may 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sage , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection are started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected passage occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which has been achieved in people after top@@ ical application on s@@ lan@@ ted skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After the simultaneous oral dose of 2 times a day , 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ ate skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ ages are not considered necessary when top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement about the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sage should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most frequently reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the location , which considered approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; by Bin@@ ding this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should the local pre@@ valence of resistance appear to be the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was performed daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and sk@@ inn@@ ed skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary contaminated traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; metabolism of the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with slight involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid les@@ ions . &quot;
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse &apos;s lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ lan@@ ted skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , develop@@ mental ox@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity have been established . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the authorisation for the public transport must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the owner of the authorisation for the public transport company comm@@ its itself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Benef@@ it for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated place show you should quit the use of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor .
&quot; do not use any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if not explicitly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment appears on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if dis@@ comfort occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gaz@@ ette , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is available in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan taken out of two doses , and hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan can be completed in two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or -@@ B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; work vacc@@ ines by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination approved since 1996 Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ ination approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix &apos;s adults and Twin@@ rix are given children as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led one month after the last injection to the development of protective antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protective efficacy was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of ambient matrix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals ( a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole of Europe ) &quot;
&quot; the standardis@@ ation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is required for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies observed after a pri@@ ming vaccine ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as a protection since it may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no more det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the addition of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the gift of further ino@@ cul@@ ation doses may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impot@@ ence in the glut@@ eal muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception , since it can occur in these cases according to intr@@ amus@@ cular approach to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ el@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 2,0@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were given to a total of 10@@ 27 imp@@ rec@@ orders at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of ambient matrix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ri@@ ence on a basis of comp@@ utation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of comp@@ utation per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in subjects after the administration of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got ambient rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and fatigue was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient matrix group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of impot@@ ence , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at imp@@ fl@@ ing between 1 and including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version rates for Anti @-@ H@@ AV was 99.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ Con@@ version rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , for the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted between 12 and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three cans . &quot;
&quot; at 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dose of the 3 dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the imp@@ ed@@ lings received either a 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with ambient or a 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with ambient in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month imm@@ uni@@ zation scheme . &quot;
the immune reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose @-@ volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ usi@@ tis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ eln @-@ vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults demonstrated the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ dium for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as swimming in wast@@ ewater contaminated water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect from infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both vacc@@ inations ( though you / your child feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child ever has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has severe infection with fever / / . &quot;
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the prescribed dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambition . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given for one month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the ino@@ cul@@ ation series ends .

&quot; ambition can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / her child will take / take other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibody ) has been administered / has or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with ambition , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as diverse as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not administered unless it is urgently needed for vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; on the basis of the data known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP rejected the notion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is swal@@ lowed - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered by a g@@ astro@@ lo@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of the leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study since Ammon@@ ites could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a false medicine , that is , without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ aint , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body smell or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia was effectively prevented in patients with mal@@ functions of the ure@@ a cycle to high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was admitted under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy is in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake necessary for growth and development .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ transc@@ ath@@ ase . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients suffering from swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ oph@@ agus phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ al if the tablets are not absorbed immediately into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium b@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ isation .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is done via the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing the neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed m@@ aturing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve les@@ ions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS in 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which is a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripher@@ y neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occ@@ ured at a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine and ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
&quot; sto@@ op@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle may be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium di@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is taken at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ transc@@ ath@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium b@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined after the addition of an individual dose of 5 g. of sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with hep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium b@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dosage of 5 g sodium b@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with in@@ filtr@@ ations or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma after night fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma gas were five times higher on the third day than after the initial gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium b@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at was not treated with toxic and non @-@ poison@@ ous doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who can not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a g@@ astro@@ lo@@ stom@@ y tube or a nose probe . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ transc@@ ath@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium b@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium b@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which is a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy associated with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripher@@ y neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; sto@@ i@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat &quot;
&quot; based on tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced for each gram of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral dosage of 5 g sodium b@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ules form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; during the period of durability , the patient can save the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g So@@ dium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products which accum@@ ulate according to the intake of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are made laboratory tests , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium b@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the medicine may go into the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , dis@@ advantages of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , feel free to contact your doctor or hospital in order to commen@@ ce appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in blood circulation ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ aint , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , skin r@@ ash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have greatly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information @-@ information .
&quot; you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS in accordance with the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and the container after &quot; &quot; Us@@ able &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MONA@@ PS , and content of the package AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; U@@ CY 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium b@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you use AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS on the same single doses or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ le ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Take a measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate out of the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Rem@@ ove the recommended number of spo@@ ons of gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( cardiac arrest ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value with electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if an@@ ox@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion may be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of an@@ toxic@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a cl@@ utter ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox , with or without a gift from GP@@ I , was as effective as the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or revenge ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other brain ins , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients recently receiving bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or cardiac infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the inauguration of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is a intraven@@ ous coupling of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a cle@@ av@@ age of 0.5 mg / kg is given , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ us @-@ Gabe from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI treatment is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ t of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed and the stu@@ d dose is administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function restrictions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second stu@@ d dose is checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney injury included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the addition of the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• serious un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ i@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in PCI patients below Bi@@ val@@ err@@ u@@ din the majority of bleeding in arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points occur , patients suffering from perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again achieved prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate inhibit@@ ors ) it can be assumed that these substances increase blood pressure . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; the experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ blocking or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ira plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the bi@@ valent group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , patients and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as defined in Table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or bleeding in the point area , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point position , reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known drop of blood , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which appeared in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial using bi@@ valent bi@@ valent in 6000 patients who under@@ went a PCI .
&quot; in the Bi@@ val@@ ira group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , patients and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following adverse events , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed into table 6 according to system organ classes . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ira is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored in terms of signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as in the an@@ ion@@ ic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in liquid phase or cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in itself re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ ine was treated with ser@@ um of patients in which the thro@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ted th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ tive th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had not been induced to indu@@ ce a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ val@@ i@@ u@@ din shows dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ err@@ u@@ din should be given below and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot handle insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in 6 months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra versus 0,30 % in human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; because of the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method , can draw a change of insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosage or break @-@ off of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , fluor@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , tri@@ po@@ xy@@ phen@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tic agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ on@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine may be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin hits neither breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed from clinical trials known to adverse drug interactions , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on dispos@@ able data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection point inside the injection range , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by a intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gluc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a appropriately trained person or treated with intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the duration shorter than with a normal insulin @-@ insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range , and 0.3 e / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like Human@@ insulin . &quot;
insulin is twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data was clear that in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human insulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in received 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with human insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ sts before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in case of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normally insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in addition 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
