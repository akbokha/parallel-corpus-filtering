<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder where the patients have periods of abnormal disposition alternating periods of abnormal disposition."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat severe to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased disturbances or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or melting tablets in patients with difficulty to swallowing pills."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are also abused as abilify, should be adapted to the abilify dose."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly used as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less extent than the neurotransmitters, to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing her recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies over to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence from 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of abilify injecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest with which Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo compared to a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was investigated by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbs the melt tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution showed patients receiving abilify doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety as the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg of doses also decreased effectively as placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (continuous movement), trembling, nausea, somnolence (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and severe manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder, as well as the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were affecting the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes associated with the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"considering the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justifying this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changes of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transient disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predisposing for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesis occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when treated with abilify patients signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"for this reason, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, there was a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipans, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a worsening of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicines with outward side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid-blocker, decreases the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore, similar can-reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"among CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore, similar can-reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be lifted to the canned height before the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with abilify can be calculated with an excessive increase in aripibosis concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethylan-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethylan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data situation, and due to the concerns resulting in reproductive studies on animals, this drug may not be used during pregnancy, unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripibozol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):"</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS increased 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS increased 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% was observed in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-idol treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% were treated with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo when potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">"enhancements of CPK (creatine-phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicaemia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4) are related to the side effects associated with anti-psychotic therapy."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"there is no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripibozole has a high plasma concentration."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder about the combination of a partially agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors are mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripibozol showed high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine d4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"at the dose of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependant reduction of the binding of 11c-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and at the coup."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>

<seg id="79">"current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study elements, including PANSS and the Montgomery Assumption Rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, an significantly higher reduction of the return rate showed for Aripiprazole, representing 34% in the Aripiprazole Group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study at schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved and in which the primary study of weight gain was, in significantly less patients a weight increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx.)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a preservation effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripibozol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a biochemical or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirroring, the accompanying therapy showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached an remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization period before randomization, Aripiprazole prevailed against the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxygenation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyisation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of poverty is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolisers over CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripibozole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripibozole and Dehydro-Aripibozole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"one single dose study involving liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripibozole and Dehydro-Aripibozole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, reproduction oxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no significance for the clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependant adrenocortical toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-state exposure to female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times of middle steam-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, Cholelithiasis has been determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripibozole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (16 to 8 times of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of sulphate conjugates found in human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- aripiprazole were not more than 6% of concentrations found in the study for more than 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility."</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which can be adjusted not satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl resin and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonyl resin and insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, causing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripleotherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced when using doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletion study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl urea in a decrease of HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin, reported a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (decreased sensitivity to irritation)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">"it has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients, when metformin is not indicated."</seg>
<seg id="762">"October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve Actos in the entire European Union."</seg>

<seg id="765">"for the use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually."</seg>

<seg id="779">"after the market launch, the treatment with thiacolid india, including pioglitazone, was reported as a worsening or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity."</seg>
<seg id="780">"it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but failing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological clarification should be taken into consideration."</seg>

<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>

<seg id="795">"a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients were performed in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medicine."</seg>
<seg id="796">"in the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a medicine."</seg>
<seg id="797">"when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occured."</seg>
<seg id="798">"Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fatty and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">"at the time of two years after the start of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid)."</seg>

<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochromium P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inductor) increases respectively lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">"after oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%)."</seg>

<seg id="2633">"in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"after the findings of pre-clinical examinations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EKG effects of previously administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous formulation follows an initial decrease in plasma concentration a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"according to intravenous administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, 5 measured middle (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the equivalent of one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the introduction of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"about 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which compared to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor."</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in metabolism of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after a unique intravenous bolt injection in gestures, the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"although in patients with severe liver function disorder the terminal elimination intensity and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposure, which are regarded as sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which suggests a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"10 out of preclinical trials, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of action."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"high doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about the 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats but not mice."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the dispensation of approval for the trafficking of hepatitis C prescribed drug Alpheon 6 million IE / ml Injection Solution was recommended."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed in the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed may not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C that responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retardated more patients than with the reference drug. Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from that, the test used in the study was to examine the question to what extent the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body trains antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected Lazerations (fissures or cuts), scratching and stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alargo might not be effective against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells where proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients on placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were examined at skin findings, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eitermed cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused to be demonstrably or possibly caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo prevailed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, scratching or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"may 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of sensitizing or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin sage, the treatment should be canceled, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection are started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials in secondary wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected passage occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentration, which has been achieved in people after topical application on slanted skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2)."</seg>

<seg id="2699">The mechanism of reapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosom that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by Binding this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the Peptidyltransfer, partially block P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should the local prevalence of resistance appear to be the use of Retapamulin at least some types of infection, advice should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix's adults and Twinrix are given children as part of a three-dose vaccination plan."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data which support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as a testament to the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or cannot handle insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-ulisin differs very slightly from the insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot be processed effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in 6 months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra versus 0,30% in human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra must not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-ulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"because of the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method, can draw a change of insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or break-off of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral hypoglycemics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, fluoroamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tripoxyphenyllin, propoxyphs, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the effects of sympatholytic agents such as beta blockers, clondin, guanethidin and reserpine may be weakened or absent."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin-ulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin hits neither breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"listed below are listed from clinical trials known to adverse drug interactions, grouped according to system organ classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on disposable data is not estimated)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection point inside the injection range, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a appropriately trained person or treated with intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glucoagine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the cause for severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the action occurs faster and the duration shorter than with a normal insulin-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus insulin-lulisin showed a disproportionate glucosal effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range, and 0.3 e / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucosal effect, just like Humaninsulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin is twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data was clear that in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postprandiale glycaemic control is achieved, as with human insulin, which is 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"insulin-ulisin received 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-prandiale control was achieved than with human insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as with human insulin, which is given 2 mists before the meal (see Figure 1)."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"insulin delivery in case of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normally insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B)."</seg>
