&quot; to translate the module website , go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; translate menu under Extras / Page . from the drop @-@ down list select the output and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part becomes part of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; automated translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations should not make important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , by making them easier to access . &quot;
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions refer to the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to load , choose settings extensions ... Open the Tools menu and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which is &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras steps . then you can view the page that has made &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if any . &quot;
the View filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Address Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views so as to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View is to display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the display of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . this way you can easily recognize large files , even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , it can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ mal representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have sensible color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle which is switched over view color mode can display depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or mapping of a different file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if it is available at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area is set by restrictions in the character of the tre@@ ble . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with Dar@@ cast Algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ buch@@ in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . &quot;
&quot; how divided the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is necessary for the labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ rent divisions . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
you can find the image gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can define the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the images per line have a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the fil@@ en@@ ame fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , you determine if the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , you determine if the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you determine if the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the saving file selection in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub @-@ folder , you can set with a slider or a turning field , up to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot;
copy the original pictures with the check box of the original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
&quot; using the commentary file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras &apos; HTML @-@ Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the Media Play@@ back for the navigation area in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu under Windows Navigation pane or using the F@@ 9 keyboard short@@ cut .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navig@@ ational section ; and drag the music files you &apos;d like to hear in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser identification adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to which you can change browser and operating system identification for individual domains , which is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the standard browser identification of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that is denied access to this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change passwords in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers on the base of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser identification to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry , you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual . &quot;
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras / Options page . you can make the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML , check if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ Document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponds to all found errors are displayed . with this check , you can make sure that your pages are correctly represented by all browsers . &quot;

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; - albums are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG Export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de , programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions below to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; for the first time you start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will additionally use as an al@@ bian library . settings digi@@ K@@ am setup collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folders . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ es recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and use this on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported resource cameras in the Help menu help menu help . &quot;
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; - albums are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions about the serial port are slow , this connection is now outdated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . Exif support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wer@@ view and G@@ wen@@ view . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; self perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree tree , over the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that an image will not be displayed in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this symbol view is displayed . which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view to your photo albums . all photos , which are managed by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album room . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they have been created on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ cies or after the date the album was created first . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an image directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to share information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by date by date by date by date .
&quot; buttons El@@ ders , average , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first image in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the context menu &amp; quot ; as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports input of key@@ word for individual photos in the area My key@@ word list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe heads in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait a short while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all preview images in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are , you can change settings digit@@ ally . select the albums page and customize the area preview images to your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you allow the mouse cur@@ sor to rest a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; photos are everything that happened at &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can choose between viewing the images , slideshow or editing the images . &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to right click on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; delete , it will be moved to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer by &amp; k@@ de ; move F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My data lists ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date window below in the date view so you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stick@@ ers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ ais@@ le , so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned key word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; or click on an existing key@@ word , and then select New key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word after clicking on an existing key@@ word , this key@@ word will be sub@@ stituted . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the right mouse button and select the Album View menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a key@@ word , you can click on the key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word . alternatively , you can right click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can set a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window when pre@@ viewing the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can select the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button , and select Rem@@ ove from the keywords menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; a time frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time@@ frame , you just need to click the lower right of the dro@@ p@@ down frame that tells the time unit . this will display all the related images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if you haven &apos;t found anything , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the results will be used in the view of My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only need to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit the search , the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select Add as Advanced Search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters available , with which you can search in certain fields by &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules will be added by operators , added . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group / delete . in addition , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the less the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar one . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you insert a picture of somewhere on the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : open @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here can be set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zoom in with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a be@@ acon in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Op@@ tic from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the thumb@@ nail , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates to you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or shooting operations on one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you navigate pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas of the same . the right mouse button is displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the illumin@@ ating table like F@@ 4 Edit ... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lamp table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each compartment you will find a built @-@ in pan function , which you can recognize at the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
the zoom works just like in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ slider below the images or C@@ trl ; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are viewing in the preview .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as to back up your images , find , protect and use photos again . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , optimize , file , file , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sorted , sorted , transformed and exported content that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving for you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you need to switch to a bigger drive some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; vacation pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in one year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos , you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 and etc . then export is a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like version@@ ing pictures , archiving , work processes , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . dis@@ connect new files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; if you forget that , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album View menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ came ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , since you should now select every photo keywords , inscri@@ ptions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute , and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords as often called hot , or categories in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ word words , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . re@@ ordering the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are maintained by &amp; digi@@ kam ; while the sub @-@ trees are tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is inter@@ changeable . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let your photos just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re certainly interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panoramic view . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I &apos;ll tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Om@@ aha Beach quot ; in the French Norman@@ die for 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . the label has therefore completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is okay if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images simultaneously . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , as with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities for using ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are countless and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove constraints on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , thus also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the working title of the photographer . examples can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify them in the picture . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; issues : plate errors , loss of record , power joints , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , time of life , temperature , data size , common super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics for reasons of data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it lies in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB , and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn with a good recorder to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
&quot; disk vendors maintain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available : Disk@@ Image study &quot;
&quot; in short : discs hold the longest possible if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature levels , the fault err@@ ations increase dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T can not detect these errors . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . so protect yourself against the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , please ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strike and therefore protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all the peripher@@ als attached to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide surge sho@@ cks which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ stop power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you start your holiday . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are supplied to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data security , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are cleaned automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission errors occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo and this is destroyed in your computer . nobody seems ever to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data way than the one in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ dependen@@ cies within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk failures on a lower level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the z@@ fs uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the workplace systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the most important ones . it leads to a lower damage , for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not fully stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is developing further there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras are heading towards the 10 megapixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no one responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss in each year . so , backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ vation always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference Insurance : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup has been made . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only sc@@ anned and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that have been changed . this is done compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ discover images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visu@@ alization , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re@@ assessment during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to have a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered based on the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; { dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ sl@@ ess , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per ink channel and full transparency . PNG can store g@@ amma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ sl@@ ess compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon it some@@ time .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block ; technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata files and the image file , and as noted above , the raw format is outdated . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation supporting fully compatible online metadata standards . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and community work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a single layer editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then you should add the metadata once more . these have been cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ came ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn off the camera to the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . some cameras will display a Fer@@ tig indicator at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , films , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the Side@@ bar properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not provide all information .
&quot; the Ri@@ der Metad@@ ata displays the internal metadata such as Exif , producer notes , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos to your computer is the click to download and then download the selection of All . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . while downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before del@@ eting the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired language selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the selected button . download the selected button until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to download the buttons , you will see a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums is displayed , as usual folder , and the list of folder sorting can be found in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; download the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can all delete them by clicking the Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you must first select them and delete selected items . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no pictures that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos are successful in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera from the camera , this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames will normally be re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames if you have photos of different recording sets in the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options to rotate and mirror the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the relevant entries are copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix in the editing field using the pre@@ fix : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further modifications , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or Up@@ per@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the sh@@ utter . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar Metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , let &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section &quot; &quot; Met@@ a data &quot; &quot; section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually turned off , and in that case it saves &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to their camera is the download button . select then upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position that can be specified in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ BE , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to combine an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users wanting to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the posi@@ tional data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that Ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical allocation . &quot;
there are various programs for Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and width of latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com presents no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to choose settings in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
select action can be displayed on one @-@ page preview or start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s professional title . these may be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the car , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others &amp; quot ; offer quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this means that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without getting lost .
&quot; store cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that will appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole screen size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image editing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant to be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with the setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value on a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it does not affect image quality since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works loss @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ sl@@ ess JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ sl@@ ess . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not supported yet , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is rapidly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the picture a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic Colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance , which was photograp@@ hed on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps more details in the pointed lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are the top lights to capture as transparent white due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture as a pier@@ cing white . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct a few parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select to re@@ construct the option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three can be reached and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also later be done in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should approach conservative . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ raw data , which have many cameras and that is available as a matrix coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure . &quot;
&quot; after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction since it is carried out during the shell conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from a color space in the other transl@@ ates to the colors as precisely as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , when a picture is opened in the image processing / Colour Management module with raw files start . &quot;
&quot; color profile folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default &apos;s ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
&quot; the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot;
&quot; the Canon pro@@ filed extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de , image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you can see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks executed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings Quick command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you will need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer and turn it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the Camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window in the Cam@@ eras menu . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can indicate the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; applied when you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without queries . otherwise , you need to make changes with the knob changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; in case of startup , this acceler@@ ates the start process from &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m Start looking for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; to search for the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if anything from the base folder was deleted , you asked whether it should delete them from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the contex@@ tual menu of preview and selection of the entries ads / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the image editing section .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size shows . &quot;
a tool@@ bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
&quot; editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should also make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore or the button The button Rest@@ ore the image processing restore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
almost every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can undo you by selecting Edit Return or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar will be displayed . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; see the section to set image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . entire image projection pages can be printed from your selection . you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Expor@@ ting printer assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without navigation arrows , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab allow the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the inscri@@ ptions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the App@@ ly button , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also read the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation from the side@@ bar is always applied only to one image . to evaluate several images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the valuation is written in the IP@@ TC field in compliance with the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the key@@ word used in this &amp; digi@@ kam site . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the key@@ word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering key@@ word words in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , they are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be placed by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album is used - dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search results . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all displayed keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place every time you start the program . it can also be disabled under settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find out that it should be a or must , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options will then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photograp@@ hed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make informed choices about color management . &quot;
if your imag@@ ery ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
your only other picture issues are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color space and have to think about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click info and then click on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to use my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! if you work in s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut or not , you need to cal@@ bri@@ ze your monitor since s@@ RGB is calibr@@ ated to s@@ RGB . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve one image in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alizing , Comp@@ are , Automatic Ab@@ ig@@ ning and Con@@ tr@@ ast extend from the menu Kor@@ rig@@ ging Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alizing : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous intensity over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; this method uses the same number of pixels when it comes to improving the contrast of an image , at times it produces very good results when improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est possible range and a re@@ viewing of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is a little limited since the colour space is worked with 8 bits per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which operates in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better om@@ itted . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynam@@ ically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ eness , click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the thumb@@ nail preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadows adjustment lets you improve or decrease the sh@@ ad@@ iness of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this will be shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences panel re@@ stores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding requires more disk space , calculation time and only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of shell images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be applied to the chapter Color Management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for multiple images . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in Color Gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provides four colour effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when one developed a partially developed pressure from a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this was the effect that the lighter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were revers@@ ed by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment ultimately generates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot &quot; &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you have a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too much satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool sound correction is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog on this tool works very complicated , you will need only the scope of the slide . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slides are cli@@ cked into the and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest one for the middle tones , often called gam@@ bas values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a knob for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values inter@@ actively as with the input values .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . the Gim@@ p level format is used .
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shadows , medium and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined output of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side : &quot;
modi@@ fi@@ y channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most meaningful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ panel to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output o@@ ads and dar@@ ker the associated image pixels . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red marking . if you want to move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the curve of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to show over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the Color Channel Mixer of image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ancy , the image will retain the general brightness as well , since the channel bl@@ ender then is the tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color will result in a visible noise coming from the color space . &quot;
save as and store buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined output of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ancy option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all the scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . &quot;
&quot; orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filtered . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate moon@@ light scenes during day@@ time .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural shade correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold to the saddle tones . this is very similar to the process of the breakdown of a pressure and the re@@ development in a sep@@ ia pad . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam , tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth resp@@ . three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool box can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your image . in detail the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce trans@@ forms it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you used the tool according to the aspect ratio previously used . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert simple a form@@ atted text into an image at any place . this also works at several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the Picture template application can be used in image editing can be used to put templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam ; email list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings are scheduled for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder updates the preview bar of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; reduction : this knob decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; provides three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but it produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
&quot; re@@ focus may be the best of the three , since it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot;
photos without focus and most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process has to be summar@@ ized with minimal differences to a col@@ oring point . this in turn results in sharp edges a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more retro@@ fitting sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often used in internal sharp@@ ening . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a focus filter already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get the control over your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening of the sharp@@ ening system .
&quot; you should be careful however , as the results do not work very naturally : sharp@@ ening sharp@@ ens the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most suitable technique to sharp@@ ening an image will re@@ focus . under re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ging sof@@ tening and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore sharp@@ ens images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the whis@@ per image that is added to the original . thus the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for a edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between tones are exemp@@ ted from sharp@@ ening and thus avoiding beauty defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ foc@@ eren re@@ focuses a picture by enhancing sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtration . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixels . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes undes@@ irable results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your im@@ shar@@ fe pal@@ ate is . this is most often caused by a previously reported non @-@ sharp@@ ening filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow if you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and store buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later leave un@@ pleas@@ urable art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this might be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
&quot; even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ry . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the in@@ firm@@ ity . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the uncle@@ ar mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture must be corrected . this picture has been made using an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of field correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regulator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the bl@@ ur of the area of the dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; ink tin@@ ting enables a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool for removing undes@@ ired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the Tab@@ s smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed accoun@@ t@@ ancy p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image . &quot;
directional dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions whereas a value close to 1 is only smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ding or CCD rou@@ gh@@ ness a high value will produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best fixed at a value near 1 .
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ y. p then defines the relative smoothing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : specify how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is enough .
&quot; angular step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is low . it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to exp@@ ire .
the buttons save as and load are doing exactly this . correct pixel errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact in the foreg@@ round that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ening level . this value sets the pixel space that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ous changes . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication stops again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the toler@@ ances of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more smo@@ ky , but it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the adjustment of the phase lat@@ tice atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , can remove noise and ph@@ asing j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save under and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was used with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tw@@ ood with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ging sof@@ tening and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; s noise , film gran@@ ular@@ ity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed pictures . &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed image . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation using the button at any time . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with identical noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film was recorded on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ ining on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures reduce to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were created by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixels from photos that were taken with a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly with high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark image . the tool will recognize automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to capture the dark picture directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by means of CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the neighbor pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less pixel are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic finish ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and margins of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 when the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ har@@ dening effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter using an equivalent transformation on a raw image created without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regulator , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the level of light rein@@ forcement at the point of highest density the filter . the default density is 2,0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ ette in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copyright @-@ protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ der covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third gra@@ der has a similar round effect , fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the removed corners to the of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree . with negative values , barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values can be revers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value affects the edges rather than in the center of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner &apos; parameter has the revers@@ ed character of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value re @-@ sc@@ aled the image size and thus results in the correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview preview the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the sp@@ her@@ ical correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or res@@ izing . best , perform this correction as the first . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would appear to be the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal support line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the margin or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transformation from the image editing or through the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as photos from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters set fil@@ ming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Option Ad@@ ding Com@@ modi@@ ty if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO slider changes the amount of film gran@@ ular@@ ity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; because the filter mixes colour channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ ming effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the highlights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ular@@ ity on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver @-@ gra@@ ves of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gran@@ ny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited version ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Oil Pain@@ ting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Oil Pain@@ ting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better for large images . smooth controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size image is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . &quot;
there are two regul@@ ators with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ arch@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells , and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks . &quot;
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of im@@ shar@@ fe effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom infin@@ ity : wi@@ pes out the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by turning the pixels at a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removal of distances : wi@@ pe the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; motion picture : wi@@ pe the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
sof@@ tening sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by acci@@ dental shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
intelligent Infin@@ ity : finds the color p@@ add@@ les in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button exit .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the picture .
&quot; you can choose with &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can guide it through mirrors or turning in the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the transformation turning or transformation mirrors . &quot;
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools , to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality . &quot;
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can the missing information be retri@@ eved or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
the buttons save as and loads are used exactly for this purpose . each image can be enlarged as text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button exit . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently under@@ rated operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . in order to cut a photo you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can change the size of the area to be cut , by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File Save or Save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and width of width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; depending on whether you use cen@@ timeter , in@@ ch or any other physical size , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool Acc@@ ording to the aspect ratio , it stores its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the co@@ iling help allow you to add help , so that you can put your images together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf@@ lets of a sunflower . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who used to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid help lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; in comparison to the third @-@ el@@ re@@ geho@@ g , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition performs the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river in this way . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spir@@ als . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also guided by the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their ver@@ tices are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can place a static object more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition which you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al options and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic variations .
with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and tool @-@ free rotation . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is to use the function Transform@@ ieren cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is Auto Fe@@ eding . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty spaces created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty spaces created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the picture gets a bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation trimm@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal she@@ ar for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can switch horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit wi@@ ping . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes are generating twice as much bl@@ ur@@ king and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the she@@ ar the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformation trimm@@ ing out of the image processing .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , depend on the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be changed . in the configuration section , you will find more information about this . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . thereby , redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; please refer to the configuration section for more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ ats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description will follow here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , bl@@ ur marks , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the bottom indicates the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview , if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar properties display the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zoom in with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to draw a square .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes created by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the Di@@ alogue Palette you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets , or browse folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let View . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m Curs@@ or is enabled under the button Color , the color will be inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . you can set this mode by selecting the check box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue , and an optional color name followed by a line character , if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ections can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .

&quot; further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty like in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool bar contains only the icon file open and the ( empty ) list of connected files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and low without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the uploaded file was modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the settings in the settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this can also change with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the program , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; when you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be fit to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one graph distributed across multiple pages without header and with another font
&quot; you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) , or ask the program every time . &quot;
&quot; opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time you are asked . &quot;
the session management page gives you the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked every time you start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up additional possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom , or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato @-@ algorithm is the standard for illuminated graphs . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm created for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene a spr@@ ing@@ back model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular manner according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can enter &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms speci@@ fying options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ eri@@ fied ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ eri@@ fied graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;

reading the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and store new images .
&quot; this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the S@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . that works you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by adding the default values duc@@ r@@ he to replace your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not otherwise be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to determine the options of the target image . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files are created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create by saving the image . &quot;
&quot; you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the impor@@ ting and screen@@ shot menu in the menu . a window appears in which you can set different screen@@ shots : &quot;
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot was made , the dialogue options of the target image with the options described above will be displayed . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world and show your photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the expor@@ ting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided by the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so , it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you cli@@ cked Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when expor@@ ting the module to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which indicates the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other authori@@ z@@ ations . you will be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button the up@@ loading of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are class@@ ed as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of a picture . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image , and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , longitudinal and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the dialog shown above then appears . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the time zone must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have track data from one location for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options for inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and press the cor@@ related button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog shows the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . for this , select the region in question and enlarge it . you will always be able to select it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ tool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
&quot; the user interface defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your related images . select a folder on which you have a write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Su@@ ction that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom or shifting . the viewer can be used with short command and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ sl@@ ess module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , as there is no compression of color information . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV to the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . &quot;
you must first select the images which are to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that you can create the module with extras MPEG slideshow .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let them black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all your preferences , you can start the creation of the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages using the button settings on the right . &quot;
the printer assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo@@ formats . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : makes sense to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original im@@ itation of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software of your camera producer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the raw image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness , and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches have no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sl@@ ess L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your pictures frequently , or to continue using it later on , you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the exec@@ utable button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to convert all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number of starting numbers and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this is the aspect ratio unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photographic print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before .
&quot; after starting the module , the pictures window will be shown with the images you have chosen . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments on the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ sl@@ ess formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the existing images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation use very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
displaying the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be shown in an endless loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance each passing between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module Back@@ ground is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop interface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; browse through these , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you click with the mouse on the entry people , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons are displayed . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , This also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined . &quot;
&quot; in order to display pictures next to the name , select the button located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the context menu you can select which view you want to display for each category . this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; you will need to specify the image for each individual . to do this , you need to select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor to your preferences and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the search window in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties . you can view this dialog on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a character sequence in the Description field or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by specific names , as you can see in the picture . here is shown by pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but rather try to try some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and choose the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then , some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays you date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will be shown in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button down and mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time frame in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following section of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described , which you can create through the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that are obvious to the viewer even without description . note that all images are from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . through this , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , he can browse your images with low resolution , which results at a lower transfer time . if he wants to get a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or one of K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings shown just above have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create a HTML page to view images . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified in creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting images is described , which you can view through the File Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not profitable to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option on this page is maximum size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be max 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from web browser or from the File Impor@@ ting ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant for impor@@ ting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alise the category people to the impor@@ ting file ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories of the impor@@ ting file should be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) capture information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , such as normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you want to start another folder tree with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry Settings g@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can modify the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User &apos;s Guide , you will find the various settings options . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings for the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing the button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of one member like in explained . &quot;
a list of the current category and in the right is a list of sub @-@ categories .
&quot; this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de , image plugin interface . closer information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; but they are not part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database first before you use them on your own images using the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I &apos;ve not warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications using the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules to use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the preview at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , you will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you would have selected people to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own images .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you see above a tool@@ bar and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window that you can browse through your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with comments . this includes information about the persons depicted in the picture , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; this is a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; since you can use them again and again , when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to de@@ fer the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved up , find the persons faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if you have included multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple Entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it down to a sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame , and you can also make your own window by drag@@ ging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also remove a frame completely . if you want to get this window back later , use the button Options ... and click here to hide the window . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you do not have a filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . simply try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the preview window . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button , or select the Edit selection menu . now the window will be shown you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures somewhere without saving you on the hard disk . of course , you need to save the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be downloaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this can be seen in the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so far you don &apos;t have to ask for the inser@@ tion of the CD . so if you are anno@@ y@@ ance of how to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard disk to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end the pictures you may want to make for others , click on the right view in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images your little sister can see , and to block the menu entry Any@@ thing out of the current view . &quot;
&quot; you specify which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , which will end all images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; remember that this picture protection is under no circumstances very safe . for one , all images on the hard drive and on the other everyone can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to save the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you will all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in view . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and drop elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have several images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button you can zoom in again The Plus button zo@@ oms in the center of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed . with the equality button sets the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom @-@ operations that work with videos , that are in and out zoom using the plus and mini @-@ paste . &quot;
&quot; with the pop @-@ up functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes about the current image with the menu item Rem@@ ar@@ ks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to highlight the image and view more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter . in you see a picture where features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have attributes to your images , these are available in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , you can simply use all of them at once with notes . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to show categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image has been selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the ch@@ amo@@ is is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to close the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the properties properties and the object in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views are displayed yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the Insert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click on App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as pres@@ et@@ ting , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points van@@ ish and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a level of Vis@@ i@@ bility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher object , or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visual stage selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangements or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you want . you can also store several windows and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , pull the starter to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle will then display the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to assign multiple views to one another , you draw the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card number plates on the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , pull the starter on the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the connector bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
&quot; you can save the current window view with the view of the window . a dialog appears , in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the scene folder view rendering . &quot;
&quot; a rendering mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can add as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ des in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the sub @-@ section sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
in combination box quality you can select the properties that are used by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this is done by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , it calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling takes the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always further divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be followed individually and can be checked for further sub @-@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection comp@@ utes . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &quot; &quot; P@@ ov@@ ray &quot; &quot; scene , select the Import sub@@ menu item ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; not yet the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when impor@@ ting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
&quot; with Copy and P@@ aste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er , and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendering . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type plates .
&quot; you can set the point @-@ of @-@ view of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separated for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separated for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all the wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for the projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
when you tick the wall a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
&quot; if you indicate soil , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when activ@@ ating edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing windows of the window or create new windows . in the section window instructions , explains how to create and store windows . &quot;
the standard window arrangement option : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window arrangements displays all existing window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a card view in common with the previous view and pending the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should note the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything without fault , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will find the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when using the button App@@ ly or En@@ ter , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might want to insert a header ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ el or En@@ ter button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite layer . when you render the scene , the plane expands up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to set its material properties . there are a lot of different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please choose first sub@@ object . the pigment will then change in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the preview pane you will see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matte black material because you have to enter the pig@@ ments settings at any time . now , please always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then go to Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
color in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; you should be able to simply execute this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the En@@ ter or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has to float above the ground , since you have shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; first sub@@ object and change the name for example in Or@@ b Pig@@ ment . click the Pig@@ ment ball , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the radi@@ ance effect and reflection permits already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metal is not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of the possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the rendering is calculated by the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects are affected by pixel . thus , the scene is edited for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
displays the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved version are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene .
repeat the most recently und@@ one command . you can only select this menu item if you used Edit Rec@@ ord@@ ings .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or to over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to modify and add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog to create tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tools with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er .
a b@@ ump map is a way to pret@@ end rough surfaces without having to model every b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as components : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
pictures can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation from &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short command for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still see the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opening &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set up a chat show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can display the program as well . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the key short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation from &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show ; in the Card Card short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
decrease the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&quot; includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ck@@ show , will also be closed , if no browser window is opened anymore . &quot;
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least issues and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reporting problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to complete your message . &quot;
&quot; and show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you can ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you may soon be speaking English , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto ; . &quot;
&quot; and show@@ foto ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to change to these settings , you need to set up the show@@ picture in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you want to display , contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view the same side@@ bar in the image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save .
&amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project site by entering the necessary information on this search site : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command prompt -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan for scanning area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview is in the window . &quot;
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview display in the settings selected , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the same name will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ites ; images save . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; this is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save saving without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images can be stored for saving without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as a default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... Change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can customize the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; Chann@@ el@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ;

&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; used like all other keyboard short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . below , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . &quot;
you can set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has several command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script is not running . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ SOR@@ R@@ Y &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should help each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if it does not have any use . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , every script itself must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now query &amp; z@@ b ; using D@@ CO@@ P functions to query other information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ers@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ be@@ for@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu item has been cli@@ cked . Sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ acs will also be used to remove the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to e.g. store data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . basically , such packages are normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be un@@ compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name , such as .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the creation of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script pack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , choose dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following in the root folder of Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report this to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; and Amar@@ ok , like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; de@@ bug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; help you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can easily be set up using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use V@@ ood@@ bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; put voice files on the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if a browser needs to be started .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; when saving the playlist , the current playlist will automatically save at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while moving . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the play , the play@@ lists window will pop up / down to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the Fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting wn fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a font you want from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set a custom color scheme . &quot;
&quot; res@@ ume playing at the start causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the playback will continue automatically with the piece at the point , with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the on @-@ screen display allows you to set up the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the required font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color spaces will pop up the dialog for color selection . if suitable colors are not activated , the default &amp; col@@ ts are used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card card .
the card card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
Browse sub @-@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders searched for music .
&quot; monitor Ch@@ anges : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination box driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another facility is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator , the machine will enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the load file last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for load .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; invo@@ ke similar performers : after activ@@ ating this setting , Amar@@ ok will retrieve a list of similar performers at the played piece . note : you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will be difficult for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; you can locate the file by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and create the file again . &quot;
&quot; most of the times , this is because Tag@@ li@@ ad crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib Developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if eg . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic mode when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use any value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are ligh@@ test by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error , if you want to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok myself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start window was converted into the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Firmware . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate the pieces , the playlist has to be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column display . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select from Play@@ list Rem@@ ove From the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , the button will save the playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably you don &apos;t have the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check for lib@@ visual . this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , this really is true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be supported by G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support even text and PNG de@@ code ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you will use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder can be supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously burn audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( such as os@@ se@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people , if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ders it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play . read this bug report . the En@@ large of Sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less j@@ ig@@ saw respond to the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes down &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . execute register regi@@ sters to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; then try to download this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all the f@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions or wishes please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and I think the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of the music you have stopped prior to bed . &quot;
how can one learn the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this instruction gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa your@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after searching in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search returns .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the Audio CD in the menu . it will open a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous rating with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can add the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . there , you can select the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece , or pressing F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Dialog Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a defined release plan that is not to bring together with the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon while playing in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . choose settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create an own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ Browser design , click on New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then , click on the Settings ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the service is free and you only need a free user name and password .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and also caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install these extensions .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the Error G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How to fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok new . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
&quot; set Up Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output lets you set up the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , des@@ elect the tick in the sound@@ card m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can get the new so much needed main@@ tainer for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there are the setup wiz@@ ard that will be shown at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or the wiz@@ ard simply don &apos;t like , then this quick start guide will help you . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them with the playlist by using the Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; when you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist &apos;s browser . in the tool@@ bar , click Add . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , then you will have the option to import play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol audio CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several ways to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installing some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages through a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text@@ box that displays the current piece or current stream . just below it is the area , the time , bit@@ rate and sample rate of the current play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ sers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . push d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text@@ box , the buttons PL and E@@ Q are also located . the PL button is enabled or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . use the playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check@@ box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many functions that there is in no other player . however , don &apos;t let the full@@ ness of functionality not deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information displayed there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistical window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title , the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation .
&quot; to view cover images in context browsers , the cover images in the same folder must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images can have any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferred . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the interpreter , lists all the albums of the current performer you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script yet , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Browse button opens a search on google.com with the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group interpre@@ ters - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are left aside . &quot;
&quot; group interpre@@ ters / album - First of all the pieces are arranged according to interpreter and there will be another split after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list . &quot;
&quot; group performer / year - album - Sor@@ ted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces will be sorted by genre first and then by performer .
&quot; group genre / Performer / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing according to your needs . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ record your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view , as well as in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box that allows you to filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours to a year . of course , you can also select your entire collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off . &quot;
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser will give you the following options .
load - This le@@ ases the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
&quot; attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you can reach the same effect . &quot;
set pieces in queue - this function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section . &quot;
&quot; all pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - This will be broadcast the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eup@@ on it appears under Differ@@ ent performers . &quot;
&quot; record marking - Change a record marked album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the associated interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click &apos; Smart Play@@ lists &apos; to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ window Media @-@ Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be used with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . in order to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Performer sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the list artist . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is finished , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , you can use tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; when the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be difficult by simply dro@@ pping down . in this case , holding down the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist does all of you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces will be displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter into separate search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , and Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; if you enter OR between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then you include the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ per : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , ask a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this looks for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
&quot; you can define the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bars , for example playlist and volume control buttons . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and setting tool@@ bars there . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . to disable the status bar option in general settings .
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from : &quot;
&quot; after you have set a piece into the queue , a number will appear next to the title in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is first played , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio osc@@ ori@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic play@@ list work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them into the play@@ lists window or click with the right mouse button on them and then choose loading . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix automatically fill up your playlist , and you can add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece by yourself , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New button complet@@ es the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a piece in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed in line with the settings . &quot;
&quot; pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you select more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side were already described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can select existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you select multiple play@@ lists , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by running the script and then click Configuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do this , select the script to delete from then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used to activate the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide should show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . in order to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will receive a bad quality while re@@ forming to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this or something similar : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as reading the original into the image file is finished , you will be asked for an empty CD @-@ medium that the data should be fired . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plugins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you can get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in addition , you can get feedback from the forums and learn new news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD contents ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ ROM . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also include &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio enco@@ ding technology and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis prof@@ ited from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ m and Enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ sl@@ ess audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; Norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without standardi@@ zation , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu holds a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise a new fil@@ en@@ ame will be asked . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog save is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project is changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for every project that is not stored , just as if you had called for each project file closing . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to happen , as if you had inv@@ oked file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the pop @-@ up dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . &quot;
&quot; this also allows copying a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows even without project file copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD which you can then burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the regular copy . besides , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes Over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , enco@@ ding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar appears at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disk . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows selection and drag@@ ging of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the button assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the mapping assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ards . thus , you can set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this reason , system administrators are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work for th@@ ief . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive , which of the accompanying programs you specify . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ cd , format DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Audio CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project using K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void ro@@ dur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Sel@@ ected for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s are read out and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ding these wa@@ v files ( these co@@ ded packages still have to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ sl@@ ess and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ sl@@ ess FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ prefer ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Which enco@@ der gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device the protection goes , it is not possible to avoid copying the copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily handling to read a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab cards for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB query of the CD @-@ data according to the request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der has been configured in the setup tab in the setup directory - enco@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of the available Enco@@ ders so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the default . it must be noted that the enco@@ der has previously been configured in the setup tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read @-@ out file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as Prot@@ ocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main configuration dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ sl@@ ess audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can return these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality compared to lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stere@@ os . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a track . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated to most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD , which is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ der program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kn@@ opf@@ tite in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the hosts . it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is meant by the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this way of configuration , so it seems , the email address when retri@@ eving the data from the server is not used ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to do so ; those who want to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading the audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ sl@@ ess compression for audio data ) can be added to the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab itself . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . for more information about the enco@@ der , refer to the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 stit@@ ches ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame must already be installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each output &amp; CD . &quot;
here we define the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the selection program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card General Settings . here , there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left as shown / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , select so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card file CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b host .
&quot; note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection box is simpler , is a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk when you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory / fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ ors &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is about 620 MB , consider this twice if it is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to the server as though many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously appearing pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
CD ; throw off after reading the last piece : check this out on the CD ; to cast off at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to make something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be blind@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to Version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted on demand . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : using a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to enco@@ de more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; running on the hard disk . we will set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we are using a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually input data instead of getting them out of the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD has to be pushed into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this is only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , search in the section Ques@@ tions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you did not select the check box for the automatic request of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page and CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current Title &apos; field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comment ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to examine the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with upper case letters or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the enco@@ der in aid to get more information .
&quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the CD Editor &apos;s window will appear again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the items for the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the play list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button Select selecting the read @-@ out process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the order tab to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you see this error message if you try to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folders for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and enco@@ ding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and enco@@ ding . with powerful machines , the result is uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; today is maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is maintained as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people who comp@@ iling from source files , and not intended for users to use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it runs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . the best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still to read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; may it do . at least after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing to this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely , if you have succeeded in obtaining the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid , is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , which other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
Dra@@ g &amp; Drop so that you can pull in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to drag on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the used method .
&quot; if you end &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . the usual file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in case of several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving with the slider . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button bar appears like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry break in the menu item , so breaks the playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics and others use both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be represented and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved which a song is used , so that you do not need to manually adjust the entry Auto text selection , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . in this section , you &apos;ll see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
to create a collection first open the collection manager . these can be found in the collection under the point Organ@@ ise .... click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the respective counter@@ f@@ eit in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection will not be saved . consider this if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when Auto Add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically add to the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to ski@@ p a song , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all Events of Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI map because all sound cards GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ LE are ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite text editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
this section tells you how to see the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . &quot;
&quot; so if you want to play a MIDI file a note with Patch 127 ( grant ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; of the patch is meant , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone represents the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map tones on the percussion channel . see for example the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to inter@@ change the first and second channel , do this in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will be used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio Pit@@ ch B@@ ender events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which should play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to an oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the Point Channel View : settings
&quot; the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . it can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices at very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed , etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a bin@@ aries distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without having to compile the problem . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window by &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to quickly listen to a file without having to add it to a collection , turn off automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so set the setting automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid as well and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I am studying Mathemati@@ cs at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Málaga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to do programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact friends von &amp; k@@ mid ( if you want to ) . before you send a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me since I might have the file already . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and by no @-@ one for making money . I would like to stress that I only want to continue to program because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - fixing the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error correction or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ m. on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and see pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter , it works as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ och@@ astic windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is reproduced in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defin@@ i@@ tive playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also through the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select the playlist with playlist and choose either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost , if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; due to the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some features can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during start and finish can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will follow the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end animation , but the user can therefore quit the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ decent &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet , &quot; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the console &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file , just like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &quot; flash &quot; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ ME ; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; with that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos;@@ in HTML pages can play back , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file can be specified by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu review ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , it needs to be done manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the need to be used and the TV channels must be used . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rek@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be identified ports that one is selected . the enco@@ ding must be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player only can use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one ) . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server has to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ n@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ Scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ d source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ d source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ d source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d source . &quot;
are there any hints how I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom drives on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine only starts up slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; K@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the ile ; -@@ website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about the compilation of &amp; K@@ ile , or if you wish to add enh@@ ancements , this should be addressed to the K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; working area . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the opportunity to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn about its possibilities the hand@@ book to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter Working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pr@@ on@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , it is also possible to use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it origin@@ ates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do . um &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just as other recording languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text sizes are defined as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ end { document } command . &quot;
the quick entry assistant from &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; document categories : hereby the type of the document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ p@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ rap@@ t &#93; , slides &#91; projector &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
enco@@ ding : hereby the character enco@@ ding is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best the UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for lat@@ ex ; for inclusion , they only need to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . this is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; K@@ ile , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; K@@ ile , it automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the config settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; once a DVI file has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document as well as other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output of the DVI ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , convert and export DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when looking back , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is cli@@ pped to the corresponding passage in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master @-@ document can be set up project settings .
&quot; fast @-@ making : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled , and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source text ) . &quot;
&quot; monitor : in this mode , the DVI ; file is &quot; &quot; advanced &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection boxes have been developed for fast inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box Fur@@ ther is for import of articles such as keywords , bonds or references . the applicable options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a term for a section , an image or different element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( option on a select field ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; manually written by hand .
&quot; the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for determining the font size . it can be specified for the font size for the main text , the joints marks , etc . there are the following fon@@ ts for disposal : &quot;
when calling &amp; K@@ ile ; two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code is typ@@ ed , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the button key@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the source text must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile , automatically exec@@ utes the storage . &quot;
&quot; elimin@@ ates the comp@@ iling of the document , should be searched for error in logging . when using key@@ boards should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size e 12 is created and only a few places should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } can then be added to the gener@@ alization of fon@@ ts within the environment â &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â &quot; &quot; ( engl@@ . hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the changes are reserved only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to raise the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold , intensive , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics printing and is invalid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a phrase can be ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } it@@ ali@@ c .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ ID is shown , then follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adap@@ tations for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . below , a quote , a few positions in the bold and ital@@ ics printing and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is a device independent file format ( English , D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as needed for the creation of the document ( see ) . when you click on DVI , the document can be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preferred search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ der files . for this purpose , only Modern can set up under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools Building can be selected . &quot;
&quot; in order to exclude advance search , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a row of the source text and then cli@@ cked on a previous search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot;
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ P@@ ut the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . for this purpose &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if an error occurs when using key@@ boards of the &amp; DVI , an error can be found . if an error occurs , this will be summar@@ ized in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file cle@@ ans the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the blo@@ cker of the La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . in order to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , the error in the log must be cli@@ cked and &amp; K@@ ile ; jump to the er@@ ron@@ eous line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the corresponding button is cli@@ cked into the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; if you select an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard will be used for rapid creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; frequent Users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; K@@ ile , created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or a new file can be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way the following steps have to be executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template will be selected instead of the default . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . an easy way to create a template should be searched for an on the internet and the steps described under described steps can be executed .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and emergence of many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made out of the menu .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its possibilities the hand@@ book to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile can begin directly with reading the chapter Working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Command reference , which can be called over the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an extended description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be used as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with selected C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par gets selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with the Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can include additional spr@@ ints . these are an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu Edit Spr@@ ung@@ marken , or the corresponding button key , allows the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump brand , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers excellent possibilities , were added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code added ; special commands for their selection . &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; K@@ ile is that the paragrap@@ hs are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands with a recur@@ ring shr@@ inking ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key root C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to Edit selection .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore offers &amp; K@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit surroundings for a more easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is present before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of ne@@ sted environment commands , the over@@ view@@ finder can quickly be lost . this command shut down the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands corresponding to those from Edit surroundings .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded brackets .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded cl@@ asp . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor is present before or behind the welded cl@@ asp of a &amp; tex group # it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when typ@@ ing many ne@@ sted group braces , quickly the view@@ finder can get lost . this command now bu@@ ts the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple application marks are used as gardens . for the purpose implementation is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple applications is used . &quot;
this automatic insert of double quotes can set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. german or french ) , so that German or French quotes can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when holding Shift , En@@ ter En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for &amp; K@@ ile ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , close &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in sp@@ read@@ sheets and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) with each other . while pushing shift ; Alt ; amp ; seeks &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the underlying line . even though this tab is not the necessary table , add to the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already providing a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes work for automatic renewal . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings K@@ ile ... &quot;
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } is added &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when the back button is pressed , the last character of the input will be removed and possibly gr@@ ind@@ ed by the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are natural when selecting a command . alternatively select from &amp; K@@ ile ; also jumping marks can be found so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible and the selected parameters can be added .
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; En@@ able settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different alarm lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as honey@@ com@@ ings of the general language used .
&quot; the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the conversion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for fulfilling the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art context or the Alt + Shift key key , the command to open the environment automatically begins and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the key button . &quot;
&quot; once this happens , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is included . &quot;
under Settings K@@ ile ; setup ... K@@ ile ; En@@ able settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the value list of the full @-@ value mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; support custom lists of sni@@ pp@@ ets , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings . as an example of a drop down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word reconciliation mode is introduced over the edit or key C@@ trl + Alt key , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large @-@ scale lock@@ ers are not helpful for automatic renewal . however , it has been noted that many changes in a document are written more than once . thus , it offers &amp; K@@ ile ; the accompl@@ ishment for all already written ones . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Pre@@ ferences K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be switched off . here , the threshold value for the display of the performance can also be set . &quot;
the files can be installed in sub @-@ folders ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder .
&quot; the dialogue graphics capture the entry of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file using ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to understand the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are comp@@ iling in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating change and generating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ eces ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 using Alt ; 4 ; using Alt ; 4 the DVI , file is converted into a PS file and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file is viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the fast @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after the comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ n project file . &quot;
the script function from &amp; K@@ ile ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed across scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts have not yet been developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
first you have to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods has :
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly well @-@ developed system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live , delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into three key book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or tags . von &amp; K@@ ile ; only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you create acci@@ dental sig@@ natures or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many sig@@ natures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sig@@ natures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; for each day you will use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures , create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you an empty ; empty sig@@ natures ; in the signature section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty sig@@ natures ; and add your signature in the lower section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures as you like . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always plenty of sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all of these tools use Com@@ mander as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub@@ strate . the combination results fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation worked , knows my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on and done the icon for the XML processor ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the binary working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired folder in the other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I said before , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book opened file is , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply cro@@ pped . if not , remove the tick in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well formed , click the Well @-@ formed verification selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and enter the location of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have been named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can take advantage of the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the counter@@ f@@ eit in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start editing the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can look for himself from the list of members of the team who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button as pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : an event for information can be drawn to the team leaders when something happens . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on , or the sending of a message when a file is added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such leaders are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
comment to input is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or typ@@ ing the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where the nickname of the nickname of the team member is , plays a role in the project consisting of the following options : team leader Sub@@ project manager Fol@@ der and sub @-@ project managers should be given the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names , as in the examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles are independent of large or small letters , but spaces around the brackets and the names are invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over a few pages that are treated after each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; big / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : when attached , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately added to the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and finish tag automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic sub@@ stitution of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et types for detection of different types of files . restoring the default values can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be st@@ ung by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis , so that a backup can restore the document from this backup during a power out@@ age or crash during the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a box path ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when changing the user interface by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range is used to control the control of warning messages from non @-@ poll@@ s .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source view in shared mode . with regard to different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Struc@@ baum settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ alization frequency of the tree can be adjusted automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D ; s . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ config Ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ part applications from third parties that can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load Only @-@ L@@ esis mode : check if the plugin refused loading . only @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then checks &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the information entered is correct , you can also save the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . appears usually in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will trigger the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened using a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it normally . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; displays the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution starts . &quot;
&quot; re@@ jects the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution is running . &quot;
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next command in the script without going into the functions or In@@ cludes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger trains the next command in the script , and if possible in functions and includes In@@ cludes . &quot;
re@@ jects the de@@ bu@@ gger to ski@@ p the statement and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value can be set to a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to suit your needs and how to help and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can help to get better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; abilities such as car completion and node trees . their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the tag folders and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folders and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folders and the tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic keys of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details about conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attribute for tags and the layout and content of the properties tab , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow fast inser@@ tion of tags to a document without a risk of a write error . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing but an element type over itself . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes a attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element -@@ type element .
&quot; is the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the data source .
&quot; the arguments applied to the method can be empty or % tag@@ Name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for one attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specify a list of elements that end a tag . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is only available when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following example , an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is pretty simple and there is an editor for it to be accessed via DT@@ D Mach@@ ined DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; to create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = version 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as a nickname .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; this action assigned key short@@ cuts . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut will be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . this way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if only one instance is running , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can take input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the default input . in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , run on the standard output output . it can be specified what is to happen with the text written to the standard output by setting the output sel@@ ector output : &quot;
&quot; when there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in any given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the Tag has attributes and you plan to use it , select &quot; &quot; Edit day &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that an input while using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action better represents , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; starting ; -@@ Tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there is any one , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to tool@@ bar , or you should adjust them to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialogue about settings tool@@ bars . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to give you a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might think that the &quot; &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by blocking all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the proper folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please customize their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable addition to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc / language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html func@@ 2 = func@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ ht@@ m@@ l. &quot;
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in PHP ; documentation as something : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html &quot;
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top end of tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the content list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements which should be available ( for PHP ; these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified them in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else who are sent . at various points there is an email menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , send tool bar tool bar with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a lon@@ er contribution , we recommend the source of resources , both for our team and for the future users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview may remain empty ) and clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the copyright of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format might be necessary . there is the simpl@@ est way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ Line : the string that exists in the Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , returns &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first introduce these concepts to them without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , available . from tool@@ bars to actions , everything that is marked global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the card holder with information and the tool@@ bars . please click in , and for more information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can right click the box with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all of the cards , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or run CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ clicking in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags on the mouse poin@@ ter , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
at the top of the editing window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown .
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; to insert into your document , click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want to add a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the tree view ( Q@@ IT ; ) allows to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and strip them . in the presentation with card holders you can find files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu that is displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be group@@ ed into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more about templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information on a script . &quot;
with this view the internal structure of the active document is displayed . by clicking a element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ ment of the tree .
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system directed to the content allows the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the DT@@ D used in the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the t@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol , and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other tool ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ! so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why do things develop , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , autom@@ ating almost every task can be increased . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when past@@ ing from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ Write , so that they are displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
switch the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bars on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there , allowing you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project Manager / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved using settings . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removing a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , the Tags menu is a sub @-@ menu item that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating or de@@ activ@@ ating the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar , if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available prepar@@ atory schem@@ ata depends on the current file .
&quot; very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes requires time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with the choice of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ navig@@ ator . &quot;
judge the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change row sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but it is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , as e.g. after completing the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted using Shift , F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled out . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us &quot; &quot; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here is the server address of the machine to which you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if this field is empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows adding files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scrip@@ ting ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; keep hoo@@ ked when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started from scratch , non @-@ hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make a precise selection of coup@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks , or by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded to the menu with Project Properties in the Men@@ tion tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which will be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations , such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing a one &apos;s own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration file configuration , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at this time . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
the project developers have free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves as well , but the Entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button call@@ able context menu : &quot;
here you can search for different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
&quot; if only more a profile is present , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal . &quot;
this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the disk save option is not eligible .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de , and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . in a project there can be many views , i.e. , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened , opened or deleted from the project or project tool@@ bar via Settings tool bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which you have the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adjusting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best can be done using the tool@@ bar menu . use and add are different . adding tool@@ bars will be treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , can be executed other actions such as tool@@ bars , tool@@ bars , or tool@@ bars to indicate which actions on this or other tool@@ bars are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action bar ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action disabled , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially documentation skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions one imag@@ ines for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions stated at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents via links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template base under global templates .
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful , if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ storage tree under global templates . see in for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure based on Anim@@ ations ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File Now Save As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template will not be visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File to save as a template save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag and drop on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as pulling and dro@@ pping or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right on a file tree or in project files , select a name for the template and secure . by default , the project folder will be backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set header lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically combine with &amp; PHP ; design , paste files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects . &quot;
template structure in sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder comp@@ lies with one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to define the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and fits all except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set to default , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text blocks . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
allows prec@@ eded or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second parti@@ tioned the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML , - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to the source editor if required , in which the changes made in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document called PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit it , it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor . pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , push the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , and the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .... Acc@@ ording to V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation : a small chip for fast machine and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools document characteristics can be chosen . this allows the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to modify the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is possible , like in a text editor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed every other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the list assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheets can be tr@@ acked .

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g returns the complete path from a file name without a path name . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . for example a styl@@ istic file format .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete match with a pre@@ age called QNAP or a given mod@@ al name will be checked . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the &quot; QNAP &quot; nam@@ esp@@ ace will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is added &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a raised holding point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . stopping points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

&quot; several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot; &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during assembly . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines . and there was no cl@@ ue to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions have been added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; this is useful if two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when you merge : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when you merge folders :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and le@@ ases the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if no one changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ in files . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ ing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; folder : \ \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n \ n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; opening dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; by pressing a folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging folder will be initiated . if a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other two folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , this would be a relatively large effort . you would first have to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy , insert and compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the notes A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while over the line . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see the color that file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summar@@ izing column of the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is scored on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ modified &#93; when you edited the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons J@@ ump to next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , every difference must be solved at the same time a conflict that has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be highlighted in all the windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this also creates a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps select another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , but appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly navig@@ ated with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in any of the summar@@ izing columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the compilation and editing window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / C@@ trl @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection into the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Inser@@ ted ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copy into the clip@@ board and manually copy it . be careful , because you could mistake the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car back@@ flow + line feed \ \ r \ . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when it is finished and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; when you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen script does not support this description , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences panel automatically creates an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line is automatically also used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the manual into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer for saving . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step is not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others save only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before moving forward to the next un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; automatically dis@@ sol@@ ves all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white signs in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , use better the functions Cho@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are handled in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge . for details , see documentation for directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
change the language of the UI . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to make &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to change the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally set over the control center . )
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; in the selection fields for enco@@ ding a brief reference appears , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the enco@@ ding output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn off this to supp@@ ress changes in white signs in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded overview column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will display a second overview column with the information you need . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply send the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
classi@@ fies the comparison windows next to each other or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first commit to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out annoying pieces or correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first handed over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used for line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line comparison to convert into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This .

&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ very character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from one another . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging , and the further operations change only the data that the line @-@ down algorithm sees . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ down pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal processor chip as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display the simulated changes without really performing it
... &quot; carries selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only have to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will inform a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files will be listed , which have been compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ... &quot;
each file and folder that has been found during scan is shown in a tree here . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually shown together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ click the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ folders and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open up all folders . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow will become red and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folders have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action from so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the later file to copy . if the files are different but the date is identical . if such errors are not fixed , the mer@@ ging of the folders can not be started . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging a file , a file will be processed by the other . the Status column displays Fer@@ tig when the merge operation was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages if something unexpected occurred . if the merge operation is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is ok everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resol@@ uted conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merged actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode is used as the target , and when using two folders , B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder , can also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only perform the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; when conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid interaction actions , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options , simul@@ ating and inter@@ rup@@ ting . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without the really made changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re done with a file , select / continue folder merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then proceed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , make &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries are combined individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them together at the later time . even if the merge operation is exceeded or not saved , these entries will be merged as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there may be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there may be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be set to folder specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that if the option contains a link on itself , it would result in an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off by default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the date of change and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off by default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this can , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off by default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file as action will be proposed instead of mer@@ ging it . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because the knowledge provided that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge mode remains visible to merge individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can turn the option directory &amp; text window into the main window in the window -@@ menu and switch between the two views by changing between the list &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file , without first having to run the folder . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be combined once you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : list menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relatively and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # contains the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differentiated if a link appears to a file or folder . then , a file is always adopted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently the differences observer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences observer . in order to start the diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences observer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are ac@@ compli@@ ces ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using the GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to go this way .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and will probably not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in the default setup , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated iden@@ tically . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is certainly the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notices every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information . &quot;
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text an other editor should be used .
after removing text suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c wins ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir displays the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure see more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy into the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not displayed in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
&quot; this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( behavior is probably changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off by default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the inscription A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , to change its size , to finish it or shift them . this works both inside a working area and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; box ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background from &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries to set up ... and exit . if however , the symbol and the name of the application and the entries are minim@@ ized , maxim@@ izing , on working surface and ending . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; box ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is shown together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ al numbers , eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; c@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid appear , as are known from ager @-@ applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical range , which is very good for representation later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up switch @-@ switch settings ... allow the dialog to appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the settings dialog . however , you can do it manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or assign it to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to this one . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users , including artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
in the default setting magni@@ fied &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor as a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; for this cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that this &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ M@@ ouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
&quot; in addition , if you push the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , store it in a file , copy it into the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops updating the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically uses your set @-@ in short command to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rest@@ ock@@ ed in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Re@@ duction &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use one area of the screen , as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the screen printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research or artist to web designer or visually handic@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mag ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or launch help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is per@@ sever@@ ing for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick is causing pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain resulting in the click of the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere proof of the mouse can also be caused by pain . suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and clicks a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent move is enabled , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it has em@@ ulated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . this way you can pull the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . this way you can pull the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . this way you can get used to it quickly . &quot;
this dwell time must reach after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Sh@@ oot is switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after clicking the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function is activated in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt ; the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System , and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer that you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de , this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set while opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will reset to the state after the last step of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best way to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent move should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation is no longer possible by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . by doing this , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue exec@@ uting mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to have it . but leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can deal with it . it is very well possible to select text to copy it into the clip@@ board , or use any other action in which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text as follows : hold a mouse click at an end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will each time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click away . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed ; this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter cur@@ es briefly . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those of the m@@ ason &apos;s pain .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain amount of time waiting for a drag @-@ button to start , before the mouse button is released . this way , drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping with the mouse can also be carried out . &quot;
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , see help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( either this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run help@@ center help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the dum@@ b user to speak to their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left of the screen ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text password book . from the text pass@@ ers @-@ books you can choose often used text passages without having to type in . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for the word @-@ word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can settle the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded into words . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) , and a default memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a mouth , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the course memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; mouth &quot; &quot; menu item ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word word editing and the site K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card language output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box under the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text passed to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed as standard input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages text@@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of In stock , the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the source memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will first only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , the editing window for text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays allows you to specify whether the text password book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; the book is saved with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text password book will not be saved . select Before Save , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word word word contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for wor@@ ding . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the required language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de documentation . the frequency of each word is simply calculated by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dic@@ tionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries to merge , and how to be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , insert a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly typ@@ ed words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is divided into two sections . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can either add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting from the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , this will be used otherwise the selected portions of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if the text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sets of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is positioned over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip is shown in the lower part of the main window with hints on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text pass@@ ers is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is positioned directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command to the voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pr@@ on@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example for the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as a default input must be enabled .
the voice @-@ over@@ s from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further linguistic service that provides all &amp; Cs ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s .
&quot; since setting up the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service page that appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with which people who cannot speak , can leave text by the computer . a list of already spoken pro@@ positions are stored , which the user can always re@@ charge . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer included . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers are ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . users also offer interesting possibilities .
&quot; read texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; cognitive applications . &quot;
&quot; the speech output takes place via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell scrip@@ ting ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application with no visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
an application with a GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browsers and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe to the list on https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . you can also find the developers at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you must install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set it right . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is used otherwise the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple printer expectations for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map @-@ card speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card @-@ card speaker will appear . this will appear automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker . &quot;
all speakers already established will appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
&quot; select a spokes@@ man from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a spokes@@ man from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
select a spokes@@ person from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a male and female voice . &quot;
&quot; click Edit . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost . go back to the card card General and check , if voice output is checked , so the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card card orders to create and manage text jobs . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab card user to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the Control Panel &apos;s system area , it dis@@ appears once the read has been read . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , stop , pause , stop and res@@ ume lyrics . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be shown if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab card user and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text which is to be read and select the main menu Tools Text . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text shown . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text which is to be read and select the main menu Tools Text . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ i@@ fy is the mess@@ aging system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events that you have set out . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de , you can set up different types of messages . you can create &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation , for example , to notify you when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel , where your nickname will appear . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ i@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ i@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed as presum@@ ed in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited before sending speech disp@@ at@@ chers to the program . they are useful for improving pr@@ on@@ unciation , to replace correctly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these jobs will be resum@@ ed after the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ al@@ erts are also news .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each job you choose from the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for output longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , news and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still more kinds of filters .
&quot; string replac@@ ements replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; provided with pre@@ defined string er@@ aser filters , which allow the creation of chat em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re @-@ format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; converter use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert and XML ; from one format to another format . included in scope of scope ; include some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate &amp; XHTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card file speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages above . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ i@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up at the bottom . editing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting up string setting filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you want ; it must only be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and sub@@ stitutes it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed from top to bottom .
click here to shift the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; these buttons allow you to load or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , add the entries from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the &amp; C@@ trl key at the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter the copy . &quot;
&quot; the string release filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string setting filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; terms can be found in the package of ambig@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c to the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the subscri@@ ber selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is located on the card file speaker , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can , for example , specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; t@@ ts ; gives a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program prepar@@ es , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , and the characteristics of the speakers arranged on the card card . with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; terms installed , you can get this by clicking the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or to delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter is only applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box are applied when applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications challenge voice output boxes via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you type
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ Windows . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML , but when using the module for festival web pages , web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to use SA@@ BLE at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read websites . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ bin is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the character enco@@ ding is set to the correct language value . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string substitute filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also parts that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ bug package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ cryp@@ to ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages at rate . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand to use another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for Acces@@ sibility , or downloaded every night currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be further developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ chers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can leave sentences or paragrap@@ hs , repeat the output or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , an application can request a female English speaker . if you have set up a spokes@@ person whose language is English and whose sex is female , this will be automatically the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click Add Spe@@ aker to Add , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card speaker device is displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text enco@@ ding for text that will be passed to festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatic . generally , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you can set the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthes@@ ized language . if you cannot select a number of controls and display this gray , the voice you choose does not leave these settings . &quot;
&quot; some parts like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are loaded already at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a spokes@@ person ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr runs not yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to read or otherwise control the read . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID ID on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can either proceed or reset in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card maps ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr are reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text orders are listed and administr@@ ated . messages of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , see in . &quot;
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card card , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn to all other orders and stops these orders . after reading the output of the screen reader , the received orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning stops the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that prono@@ unce messages . if you have &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who enters the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output is included in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for regular text orders . for news , warnings and screen readers &quot; messages , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ i@@ fy messages , start t@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card card will appear al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to turn &amp; k@@ de preview ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played will not be read by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone first men@@ tions your nickname in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
all events listed in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds can start text into individual sets . this allows you to start or stop writing assignments on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of punc@@ tu@@ ation filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further punc@@ ture recognition filters , but beginners will get rid of it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the subscri@@ ber selection by trying . turn on the subscri@@ ber selection and select text to read . turn on the card card again , select which speaker and select . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; you will then be able to stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the standard set of rules will automatically be set up when you start t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional dig@@ its and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries ( tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ - characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set of rules is re@@ tains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the standard set of rules , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card card language selection , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . &quot;
use of the Spe@@ aker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most suitable speaker with all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select the speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is closest to the original set @-@ up . &quot;
select the method to input the desired language settings by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
select this check box if the property has priority over other features . you can also set multiple mark@@ ers here .
&quot; because language is a critical factor when dealing with output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language other than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the area of the speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default Spe@@ aker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is written for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) . &quot;

G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it has been finished . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem does not solve it is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message stating : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in the audio card audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive can offer an adjustment for speed even on the card card for intercom device . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML transformation filter , and set up the intercom speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice .

&quot; I have added a separate chain release filter and now I can work in &amp; kt@@ ts , no more in terms of attachment or return . on the tab card orders is displayed , the order will consist only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not filter out . instead , use a filter for punc@@ tu@@ ality recognition instead . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and let a text read . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ x audio program is used for the general setting of speaking speed , but it is otherwise not absolutely necessary . Debian users can use the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . &quot;
&quot; download &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( tar packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;

&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you have to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to enter MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for a festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival creates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts di@@ phone .
&quot; in this process , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . it is required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first you install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS English Festival from
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , registration of bug fixes is not required , you just have to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; ( voice @-@ location &quot; german _ de@@ 2 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 votes will not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PAT@@ H .

download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
on the card device device speaker select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correct .
&quot; epic is a free , lively speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; select the Czech or Slovak language and ep@@ os T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the Map List . enter a &amp; Con@@ sole ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual machine on your system . with &amp; Java , neither pitch , volume nor speech speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts , with any speech synthes@@ izer that can be activated in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the network settings option in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this program will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and release of the release . by marking the setting of non @-@ recur@@ ring requests , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gra@@ yed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , the settings can only be viewed , the settings can only be viewed , the system administrator mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the Ri@@ der network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der network interfaces :
the settings displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... will be edited in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with other options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , hence no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manual , the TCP / IP address can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . switch off an switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . disable an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking interface ....
defines the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface has to be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine is called http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS records can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons on or under . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the New Name Server dialog will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... &quot;
&quot; the list named in particular describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address @-@ references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting , if there are no DNS servers available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains list @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the Add button . if the known host has multiple alias names , de button Add several times and enter the alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit ... Modi@@ fied calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes you have to set the following command .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but also the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 5 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focuss@@ ed on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address is to assign to a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the contact person who has a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there &apos;s another content in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&quot; the default k@@ de appears ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose to fold out , you &apos;ll see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; use the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the time schedules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX , to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the base of tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which was beyond the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to create a fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; not the pre@@ ten@@ se on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ spell , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the volume by opening the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before casting out the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; by changing the symbol for the tape , you can see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a tape type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not match the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not match the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not need to be form@@ atted before you use the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting the volume , DAT drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape name and the capacity , the tape continues ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all the data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the volume is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on any of the archives and select the menu item ....
&quot; once the scan is started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work@@ folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the restore , the files that are to be restored must be checked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the recovery settings , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the belt index file based on the belt content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
&quot; as a result , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are stored , such as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be included separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar irrespective of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; lt ; lt ; and lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command ms load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ector during the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , dis@@ connect &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically disc@@ ar@@ ded the tape . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy connectors . &quot;
&quot; the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ containing block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with the GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work unless they are incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides information about your system , or where the system provides the various protocol files . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
&quot; and k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems encountered on their server . hence , try to provide some advanced features , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , try to open the system log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not appear to you , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator rights . &quot;
&quot; you can also filter the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion , or after inserted strings . in addition , enter a string in the filter bar . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will display the entry All . then , a protocol line will only be shown if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select a different entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will only be compared with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the name of a process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ strip , so tell you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the stage errors are displayed with an eye @-@ catching color as the protocol lines of the level indicator . the color representation of protocol lines can be shut down setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can ski@@ p the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the menu items to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You find more up @-@ to @-@ date information on the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program start at boot of the system in the &amp; Linux world . and , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go down here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; the r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel tries in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
&quot; the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab , where you should see a line like the following : &quot;
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default set level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have something confused , then you can repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server run@@ level that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start ( or stop it ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between running level@@ n , or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if you draw up an entry from the field of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them to a new level . to just copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ti@@ tion@@ number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to recover messages thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas ( Available Systems Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ti@@ y number or the name of an item manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ levels , and now the machine starts anew . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the lin@@ ux single at the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , then press the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution at Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated without message when their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this guide can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card@@ boards , the user group and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ cards ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other card maps will appear , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
&quot; this card @-@ card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user . &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space restrictions .
&quot; the card group informs about the group assignments of the selected user . the standard group , which is owned by the user , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog &apos;s Properties contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching tool@@ bar button . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
