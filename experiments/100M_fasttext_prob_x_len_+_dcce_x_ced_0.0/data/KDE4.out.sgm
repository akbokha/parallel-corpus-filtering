<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different tool- and text views so as to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView is to display nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the display of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. this way you can easily recognize large files, even if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, it can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Tremal representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have sensible color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle which is switched over view color mode can display depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or mapping of a different file property like name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify if it is available at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area is set by restrictions in the character of the treble. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"with Darcast Algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Trebuchin & FSView, this goal is not always respected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how divided the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is necessary for the labelling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recurrent divisions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer.</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions about the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to read the preview images of digiKam. Exif support is required by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the preview images. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showerview and Gwenview."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function than the changes in & digikam; self perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree tree, over the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that an image will not be displayed in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filtering on the filename only works if this symbol view is displayed. which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the AlbenSettings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view to your photo albums. all photos, which are managed by & digikam, are stored in a single album room. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they have been created on the hard drive, according to the name of their collection in the Albencies or after the date the album was created first."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an image directly to an album. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move it to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to share information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections."</seg>

<seg id="91">"buttons Elders, average, New Year: these set the date on the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"if you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first image in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol."</seg>

<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports input of keyword for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window. album collections always have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two loupe heads in the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered based on the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this always means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with you and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk:</seg>

<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format.

<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">"the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make informed choices about color management."</seg>
<seg id="379">If your imagery fulfills all six criteria listed below then you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture issues are by e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should one use another color space and have to think about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click info and then click on Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to use my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! if you work in sRGB colour gamut or not, you need to calbrize your monitor since sRGB is calibrated to sRGB. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve one image in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalizing, Compare, Automatic Abigning and Contrast extend from the menu Korrigging Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalizing: this method scaled the luminous intensity over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method uses the same number of pixels when it comes to improving the contrast of an image, at times it produces very good results when improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a reviewing of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is a little limited since the colour space is worked with 8 bits per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which operates in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better omitted."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whiteness, click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"a histogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminancy."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadows adjustment lets you improve or decrease the shadiness of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this will be shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store exactly this. every setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences panel restores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality images. this coding requires more disk space, calculation time and only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of shell images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be carried out through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be applied to the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for multiple images. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in Color Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digikam; tool color effects provides four colour effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when one developed a partially developed pressure from a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this was the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were reversed by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment ultimately generates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called" "Velviaquot" "effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photo. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you have a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too much saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool sound correction is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog on this tool works very complicated, you will need only the scope of the slide. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three slides are clicked into the and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the image. on the left-hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest one for the middle tones, often called gambas values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a knob for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change output values interactively as with the input values.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later. the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">"when you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, medium and sun tones. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined output of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:"</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitizer; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but it produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus may be the best of the three, since it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process has to be summarized with minimal differences to a coloring point. this in turn results in sharp edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more retrofitting sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often used in internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter already during the reading of the image. if you deactivate it, you will get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening of the sharpening system.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful however, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening sharpens the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most suitable technique to sharpening an image will refocus. under refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Corrigging softening and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpens images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the whisper image that is added to the original. thus the sharpness of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for a edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between tones are exempted from sharpening and thus avoiding beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refoceren refocuses a picture by enhancing sharpness. it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'sche Fission. the Gauß' sche folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixels. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß 'fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes undesirable results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"palate's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your imsharfe palate is. this is most often caused by a previously reported non-sharpening filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow if you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later leave unpleasurable artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this might be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurry. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the infirmity. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the unclear mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture must be corrected. this picture has been made using an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of field correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte sets the blur of the area of the darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"ink tinting enables a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool for removing undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the Tabs smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed accountancy p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions whereas a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grading or CCD roughness a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best fixed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above ally. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angular step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stepwidth [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is low. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to expire.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load are doing exactly this. correct pixel errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a unique black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter.</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpening level. this value sets the pixel space that the filter looks forward to determine luminous changes. if it is increased, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication stops again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artefacts without losing any details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the tolerances of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more smoky, but it also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase lattice attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, can remove noise and phasing jitter at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved into the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was used with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften softwood with the menu entry Corrigging softening and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß 's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitized pictures."</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are to be seen in uncompressed image."</seg>

<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set filming and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the Option Adding Commodity if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO slider changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">"because the filter mixes colour channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filming effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the highlights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digikam; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver-graves of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, granny sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the edited version (2). the used film sensitivity is equivalent to ISO-1600.</seg>

<seg id="600">The & digikam; Filter Oil Painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better for large images. smooth controls the smoothness or, from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the machining is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size image is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the & digikam, filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon label filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">"the & digikam, filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monarched landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>

<seg id="615">Zoom infinity: wipes out the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the sharpness a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial sharpness: blurred the image by turning the pixels at a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal of distances: wipe the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion picture: wipe the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening sharpness: blurs the image softly in the dark and strong tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits or glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by accidental shift of pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Infinity: finds the color paddles in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new."</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button exit.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of droplets on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can choose with & digikam; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentrop Filters. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can guide it through mirrors or turning in the correct orientation. the tools can be found in the transformation turning or transformation mirrors."</seg>
<seg id="629">"photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools, to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality."</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can the missing information be retrieved or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to blow up."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"keep aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and loads are used exactly for this purpose. each image can be enlarged as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo bubbles is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button exit."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">"editing a photo is not only a frequently underrated operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. in order to cut a photo you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"you can change the size of the area to be cut, by simply dragging it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or Save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and width of width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"depending on whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool According to the aspect ratio, it stores its settings depending on the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the coiling help allow you to add help, so that you can put your images together better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-elregel, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaflets of a sunflower."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid help lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"in comparison to the third-elregehog, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition performs the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spirals. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles are also guided by the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic variations.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible. this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, then it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image editing and tool-free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the button Preferences you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix it is to use the function Transformieren cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is Auto Feeding. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: shows the width of the new image, including empty spaces created through the transformation, in pixels."</seg>

<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective the picture gets a bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes on the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation trimming out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal shear for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can switch horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit wiping. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two notes are generating twice as much blurking and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformation trimming out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digikam; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, depend on the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with & digikam."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn on anti-aliasing, it calculates and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling takes the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel is always further divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be followed individually and can be checked for further sub-division. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. when you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if you want to play a MIDI file a note with Patch 127 (grant), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here the term" "drum patch" "of the patch is meant, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone represents the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map tones on the percussion channel. see for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to interchange the first and second channel, do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which should play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>

<seg id="2030">First you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter. example: sh / home / myHome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myscript.sh. this way tries & quantaplus; the script at the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:"</seg>

<seg id="2033">"% pid: is replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; if only one instance is running, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"the parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file."</seg>
<seg id="2035">"in addition to the methods listed above, a script can take input from & quantaplus; to the default input. in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input. possibilities are:"</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, run on the standard output output. it can be specified what is to happen with the text written to the standard output by setting the output selector output:"</seg>
<seg id="2038">"when there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in any given case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the brand."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions."</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"complete all and, if the Tag has attributes and you plan to use it, select" "Edit day" "dialog when available so that an input while using the action is possible."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that the action better represents, we will use & kiconedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Graphics further programs (or where else it is located in your distribution)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit size."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP."</seg>
<seg id="2047">"with regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be interpreted as less, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol is a & lt; starting; -Tag in the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there is any one, or confirm with OK to complete."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; -functions to toolbar, or you should adjust them to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set dialogue about settings toolbars. make sure the toolbar you want is selected."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"I want to choose the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"for example, I would like to give you a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2054">"please note how the separator support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might think that the" "Conqueror" "button is the opposite of the start button."</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by blocking all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the proper folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please customize their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened from the appropriate type."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable addition to & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc / language. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html func2 = func2html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html."</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in PHP; documentation as something:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html"</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is directly referenced to a file (and consequentially at the top end of tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the content list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements which should be available (for PHP; these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified them in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are certain that these are good and worth it to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else who are sent. at various points there is an email menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) send with email, send tool bar tool bar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; -users can download them. the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a loner contribution, we recommend the source of resources, both for our team and for the future users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview may remain empty) and clicking OK the uploading will be started."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the copyright of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tagXML format might be necessary. there is the simplest way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">"Doctype DefinitionsLine: the string that exists in the Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear"</seg>
<seg id="2080">"fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, returns & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and to get full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first introduce these concepts to them without their understanding and quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus, available. from toolbars to actions, everything that is marked global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which allows the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the card holder with information and the toolbars. please click in, and for more information about these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can right click the box with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing the current, other or all of the cards, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-clicking in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags on the mouse pointer, or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editing window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; to insert into your document, click on the icon that represents the tag. if you want to add a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in different fields in a dialog."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the tree view (QIT;) allows to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and strip them. in the presentation with card holders you can find files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu that is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be grouped into three categories, depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project. more about templates is available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you will find information about the scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view the internal structure of the active document is displayed. by clicking a element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking a element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refresment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"this tree appears under the other tree views. with it, you can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the entry system directed to the content allows the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks."</seg>

<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions stated at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents via links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template base under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"documents can be from any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents can be created in appropriate subfolders."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"this type of templates is useful, if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples can be found in the pre-storage tree under global templates. see in for more information on the templates tree."</seg>
<seg id="2202">"as the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus."</seg>

<seg id="2206">"the creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as pulling and dropping or inserting over the file tree of Konqueror."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"you can click on a folder to the right on a file tree or in project files, select a name for the template and secure. by default, the project folder will be backed up, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template."</seg>

<seg id="2209">Template structure in subwindow Templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each folder complies with one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to define the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties. the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2211">"a selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates."</seg>
<seg id="2212">"this is enabled by default, and fits all except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set to default, it would deactivate templates in this path unless explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text blocks. if nothing appears, you'll probably find yourself in a root folder."</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preceded or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows copying contents to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the matching headers / footers.</seg>

<seg id="2215">"& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second partitioned the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML, - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source editor if required, in which the changes made in the source code are visible."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor in a document called PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit it, it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works just like the first, except that the changes both in the source text editor and the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor. pressing F9 this mode is already active, push the active cursor from one window to another, and the position in the document is maintained."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Quanta.... According to VPL, you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatically. in general, the recommendation: a small chip for fast machine and a large span for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"assuming you want to change the title of the website, tools document characteristics can be chosen. this allows the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this allows you to modify the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2221">"meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. clicking on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column."</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>

<seg id="2224">"the use of the cursor is possible, like in a text editor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"the insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it is to be noted that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed every other surrounding anchor tag."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time changed the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during assembly."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within one line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"this is useful if two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when you merge:"</seg>

<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if no one changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ in files."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2300">"what is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these features are, this would be a relatively large effort. you would first have to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; now you can simply copy, insert and compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only the drop-down of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>

<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform multiple replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>

<seg id="2517">"the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself. by doing this, the status of & kmousetool will be reset and you can continue working as usual."</seg>

<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, try to open the system log; first, the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not appear to you, and it opens itself instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator rights."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also filter the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion, or after inserted strings. in addition, enter a string in the filter bar. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will display the entry All. then, a protocol line will only be shown if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select a different entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will only be compared with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the name of a process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filterstrip, so tell you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the stage errors are displayed with an eye-catching color as the protocol lines of the level indicator. the color representation of protocol lines can be shut down setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can skip the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to display all new added protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the menu items to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You find more up-to-date information on the Sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program start at boot of the system in the & Linux world. and, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go down here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"the rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d when you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel tries in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"the standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab, where you should see a line like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default set level 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have something confused, then you can repair it by restarting the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be invoked with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server runlevel that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between running leveln, or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if you draw up an entry from the field of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them to a new level. to just copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sortitionnumber of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to recover messages thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to enable the different working areas (Available Systems Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sortiy number or the name of an item manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runlevels, and now the machine starts anew. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the linux single at the LILO -Prompt linux single, then press the / etc / inittab file and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution at Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) are simply terminated without message when their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this guide can be added to this manual."</seg>
