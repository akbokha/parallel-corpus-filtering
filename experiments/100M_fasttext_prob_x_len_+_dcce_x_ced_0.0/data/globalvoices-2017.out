&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American writers and pursued his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , un@@ covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was as if it &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very black@@ ish letter of love about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he is dealing with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; in his opinion , he never lag@@ s behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the nomin@@ ee nominated by the Party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist &apos;s program , which takes people from all over the world , is a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps also agreed not to agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump warned his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call tr@@ ump voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( O.@@ B. ) : as much as &quot; &quot; the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( white and Whi@@ pl@@ ash let@@ ter@@ play , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I must think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , could have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ ac@@ a ?
&quot; the music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a big gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kms south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered youth such a rare ray of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of Cat@@ ac@@ a - a village located practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ ac@@ a where the recycl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and drums all from the gar@@ bage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local win@@ emaker and teacher of the children of Cat@@ ac@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in gar@@ bage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments from re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance on :
the world produces about one billion tons of gar@@ bage every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in Cat@@ ac@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra performed its music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ publication takes place within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly upset and less inclined to welcome a criminal criminal of this type on their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were swi@@ f@@ tly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and safegu@@ ards resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , which then exp@@ elled the prime ministers from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like minded and work together . they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail tag , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , individual countries can exchange existing lic@@ ences , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspic@@ ious routes can be discovered - such as suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its captured fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the move and possibly , whether they have a criminal liability . &quot;
&quot; countries that are illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the so @-@ called platform was created to gain an estimated USD 20 million in lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of the illegal f@@ ishers entering East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also , even those illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include such actions as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit roy@@ alties , speci@@ fying fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish @-@ protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You don &apos;t want to run my port . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole now tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
until now the closed front works .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has discovered criminal networks that had distributed counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tr@@ acked and found wing@@ ed ships .
&quot; due to his co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for fighting crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to breed suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track the illegal vessels that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , a NGO , who also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that combines various information levels . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , to find criminals acting with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence this un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of every single tr@@ ack@@ able vessel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources into the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to be conf@@ is@@ cated without a license earlier and hardly had to face consequences , now know that they are being observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fishing boats have more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets there on board , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars van@@ ish annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined together for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of producing even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; Cop@@ eland said . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recent M@@ ember@@ ship Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they prevent illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ as government rejected the motion of opposition to a referendum on the removal of the opposition , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by assem@@ bling themselves on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - including Bar@@ inas , the Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira national park , located in the central @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ an by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the resolution of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the de@@ position of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum has been considered the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Party ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a twelve @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ lowing Day and a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , to continue on November 3rd . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among others as follows :
&quot; it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;
continue ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ witter@@ .com / 9@@ Cy@@ V@@ Gl@@ d@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the programme &quot; &quot; Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures , which tell about con@@ front@@ ations , and reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
especially big waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government according to their own testimony . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no skir@@ ts because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers don &apos;t have !
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the amount of suppression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an office building process - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ umer@@ able people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your exercise !
on the street !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or buy . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were being investigated , committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept family secret .
&quot; in the situation back then , I believed that was right . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that he is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not realize at that time , that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano . during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities which he had witnessed as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
just keep in mind that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I will have to save you .
&quot; the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; that is why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoner . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were placed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I came in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a camp bed and metal feathers .
&quot; later , I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was lying there . &quot;
&quot; they often tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;
photo : Com@@ is@@ i@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there in it was horri@@ fic ... like a fil@@ thy win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were able to bind ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people lie quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you do so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to indications from survivors of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ app@@ ings came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and were then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from the top came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time , at that age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war loo@@ t &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military later , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges that one pic@@ ks up to an enemy that one has fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war @-@ loo@@ t but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who d@@ rank cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not criminals ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against rage , struck me and cried out : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense was accused of being a conspir@@ ing of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay hold on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but what makes the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl to the house whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy for them to put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
had these people not also had families to whom they could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last disgu@@ sting act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they have been crus@@ hing and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something of course always remains .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were really good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed horrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , let me know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
2010 I received the first ad .
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally have said against my own father .
&quot; in May 2015 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest still standing before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including heavy , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

&quot; the jud@@ gements in the &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers in the Spanish to the magnitude of the judgment . &quot;
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims , finally in August between March 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 Supp@@ res@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended prison sentences and in nine cases pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were sp@@ ells . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ ge : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ stat@@ us@@ ror@@ ism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees . &quot;
&quot; Pier@@ o De Monti , together with his pregnant wife , was kidn@@ apped in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la . &quot;
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
&quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer who founded the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who has been representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the search for it lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial , which is now led by human rights organizations . &quot;

translation error makes older people in YO@@ TO &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the shield with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s licence . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Kyoto Japan city , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , during the last month witnessed a very un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; elder motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; on a sign , wron@@ g@@ ly - perhaps also with mal@@ icious intent and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n newspaper in Kyoto wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the invalid English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate though gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are really sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; the police said . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was deno@@ unced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country , however , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents is total , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ter , which is not mentioned in the name , brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo with the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; Is this ( &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; ) , for example , not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So incorrect , the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the original text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , costs or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations company @-@ internal . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , are made to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions , which arise through machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards , careful translation can be expected . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto is hopefully using a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; also other online transm@@ it@@ ters contributed recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ position@@ ists , who oppose the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an provider are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Venezu@@ el@@ an guests with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ film later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier investigations by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby the DNS servers correctly answer requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , was put into custody on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina will fight for the rights of children and collect testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ min@@ tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Kur@@ ische , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Lost Schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the University , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she , from which something has become , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes their min@@ ors son or their min@@ ors daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay inn@@ umer@@ able days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked to Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and deno@@ unced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees in general still@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ v@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family that their daughter in the belief that they conclude their training , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes care of the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the faith is that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive training and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra moved to Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply involved in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called Cri@@ v@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ de@@ ta
&quot; Cri@@ v@@ tas are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ad , in which her father worked , had to sign up for bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all the way , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the home of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked every day between four and six hours . &quot;
she had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , cle@@ ans@@ ed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial articles such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to not believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not keep up with her . &quot; &quot; the master had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they thought I would learn &quot; bad habits again there . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible to lose .
&quot; she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the chic@@ anes whose Cri@@ mean tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ de@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I didn &apos;t belong to any group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ v@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the Administr@@ ator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city counc@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the display received five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , which also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the interior , who wants to work . &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad cre@@ pt again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was closed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ v@@ tas report , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ v@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ min@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í , and the system of the cant@@ een , where they are still in a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill introduces Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary members recently voted on a bill to &quot; regul@@ ating use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of accepting the law , users would have to register with their right names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a bu@@ ckle . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ves and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running through the Internet and is used to communicate with others via voice , video editing and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to apply the registration to the users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media enterprises . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ adh Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament and promot@@ ers of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and received a username and password from the ministry of telecommunic@@ ation to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it has not been known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they were forced to control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and to supply them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and should be ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a crime against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those deemed to thre@@ aten the &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish environ@@ ment@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards in the war drawn by war

&quot; this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the Kurdist@@ an Mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working on protecting the hor@@ se@@ ful Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that w@@ anders through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus saxophone ) . altogether , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find fewer and fewer prey . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free game is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to passion@@ ately reveal another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , it has also become a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an area . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and filmm@@ aker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the North @-@ east Japanese daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made over the last six years to re@@ build the life of those killed by the &quot; &quot; triple disaster &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom bomb in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was an et@@ ectable pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had removed whole coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had a nuclear accident , and already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the special report of the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned sub@@ stitu@@ tions ( wholly @-@ owned , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . here , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the disaster , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( who has to be ev@@ acu@@ ated , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to settle into final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , who were ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 , still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ated after the disaster were settled in final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by disaster , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have moved extensively . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land destroyed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the nuclear block zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that almost half of the coastal residents have been living since the disaster , making it more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture , &quot;
&quot; in its edition commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ causing nuclear disaster that Japan had ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , something more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into long @-@ term replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the stand of 2017 , more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres , which are still in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has been strengthened for the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being hit by the police during nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a wide spread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit last week . last Friday , a police officer held him against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University University Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a shepherd @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him on this Saturday and put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local photo@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if police officers were beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several param@@ il@@ aries are rus@@ hing to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the costs of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here was the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ eman , who struck him with a stroke . &quot;
hand@@ le@@ bars &amp; Gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which there was brutal police stak@@ es on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speakers to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped off road protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window screen . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their cover pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also be recognized if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by de@@ generation in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills joined the doors in Cuba . ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no notable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after the recovery , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some ex@@ changing the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back into operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene is remember@@ ing that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not held . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production rose 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad yields are no longer a new thing . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway station of the community saw already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive , they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar should remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly go into history , &quot; that was the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane mills came , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; dec@@ eption . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of Jubilee , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially recorded documents , which would be distinguished only in terms of the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; for two years Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the still@@ ed factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in operation , &quot; &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ top producer has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for the past five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;

after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to lo@@ osen them , they also stopped to tar@@ nish the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories . &quot;
they were to be spar@@ ed .
&quot; without prospects , many young people left the region once again . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
forty @-@ nine yields bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a post @-@ supporting person , nevertheless he for@@ gives the lies one told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes for 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot;

first Nations te@@ ens use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do so by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , Mobile Ton@@ studios have been offering mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach young song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were run by educ@@ ators David Hod@@ ges who lives in Montreal and worked together in Northern Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars .
&quot; the workshop begins with the assumption that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West Canada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always fluent in the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a st@@ anza in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and continue our youth as well . &quot;
&quot; thus they can do what they intended for the Creator , &quot;
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ilia ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

in Japan it is possible to see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
the Tokyo @-@ G@@ a film maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago in the Tokyo @-@ G@@ a cinema .
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they do not even attract them any more . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic rib@@ bons decorated mobile @-@ bands as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ecti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling cup@@ boards for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences becomes increasingly more complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the Com@@ ic .
&quot; some cell phone stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell with salmon . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortable . &quot;
our newest mobile stand has the form of melting snow .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to h@@ ash@@ tag # Proc@@ e@@ Fron@@ tier , which will be staged . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the decoration of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the bl@@ asts and killed periodic@@ ally appear only in statistics . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bon@@ ding in the hundreds of secret dit@@ ches , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; to live with the drug trade &quot; &quot; ) , which will give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who fell into the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime is not only concerned with our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and that whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( german : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells just these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for every weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is with me here too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a certificate of death . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; every day I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the perpetr@@ ators when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that is as if they ta@@ sted those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened something like that . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere figures in a statistic . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; permanent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to say that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family has been pill@@ aged by threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals were squee@@ zing money from their business month by month , but also torn apart their family . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days .
&quot; the pain over it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation called by force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; &quot; ch@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mor@@ nings per day . &quot;
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories are living in the face of ever @-@ new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has been tor@@ turing the country over the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strö@@ m. ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ our or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to capture trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copying of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample di@@ ligent reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war Africa , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous path@@ ways full of pot@@ holes , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank wagon fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; representative representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ oped , including a cinema nearby , full of people who watched the football world champ@@ ionships . &quot;
houses br@@ anded and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lying on the floor , while people look at them . &quot;
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been reviewed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and unfortunately , real , but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 comb@@ at@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on attacked .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained to count the cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be visually displayed .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ answered , but the military base in Bag@@ a had been a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the image from the DR Congo emerged as it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has documented assignments in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were described pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts such as the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken by an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 claimed , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to capture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , have also mistakenly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures of 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded wrong reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have limited examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what they have been published on which side they have been published . through this we want to portra@@ y the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which have been linked to each other in some cases ) may be several examples of ab@@ usive use .
here are some cases that can be flus@@ hed completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein cleared up in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;

&quot; when the image later fell into circulation in the context of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was we@@ ather@@ ed for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ pt ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison from Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a fake . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) are also not fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and sometimes they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original disaster of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photograph was used in relation to major discussions about silence in connection with the mur@@ der@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ der@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo and in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures of readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something , but which can actually be detached from the context or to completely ab@@ usive nature . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false write @-@ downs should also take into account how international it can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses according CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected throughout a period of time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Imag@@ ine your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The la@@ z@@ iness or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you heated up in cold days in the sun .
in Birds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they de@@ pl@@ ish other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page yet want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words , showing how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; highly appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ atable , are invited to upload their favorite tunes here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka changes with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the disaster zone of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 men were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of floo@@ ds and sl@@ ud@@ ge win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been transported to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka Tweet deliver regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rain falls on their way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ o@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five are being made ready for the transport of emergency supplies destined for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also clari@@ fied to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ an@@ ana .
&quot; today , call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area . &quot;
the tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ac@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to retrieve a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful marine rescue operations for flood and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of normal@@ cy . &quot;
Muslims who cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trust@@ s me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some maintain the iconic image of a woman with a head scarf high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ err@@ ing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend watches me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people I work with or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
they kidn@@ apped me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who , as I do not fit , will be dispos@@ ed of . &quot;
to be taken into account
I don &apos;t stand alone with it alone .
&quot; this is even the poet who is selling poetry in America , Rum@@ i . &quot;
what pictures do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , Rum@@ is &apos;s religion was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these pictures . &quot;
but these images also stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narr@@ atives over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women had led their countries over the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head scarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , these are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken by Afri@@ cans , who had been associated with slave ships . &quot;
it li@@ stens the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative has taken our collective imagination such deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often Sik@@ h men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has mis@@ er@@ ably failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scrap@@ ers . sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan deno@@ unced the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I tired Mus@@ lim@@ a and American woman now ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of catching up my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with - &quot; &quot; respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ esting , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we do not have to be a the@@ ological expert to be a Muslim or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with financi@@ ers , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the way we are telling them , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger that ro@@ ps a woman the veil . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anic church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbour , my rock in the br@@ anding see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the usual ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms , and whis@@ per her Arab verses for protection , which seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim community is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging to me is the image of my grandmother , mat@@ ernal with her sisters , how they gain a competition for the art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi over decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings painted by Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me to speak if I had a bad day .
&quot; being Muslim consists in how she taught me to relate to God : Allah , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that - for centuries - was colon@@ ized by a &quot; empire &quot; colon@@ ized by a company called Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan win@@ ed around his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
being Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aircraft bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country from one century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ ian under@@ tan of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever had and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy comes home by the United States and bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a freed black slave with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , with multiple con@@ d@@ tions , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion bul@@ lies more possibilities than a cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two @-@ ness &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from the countries that are being bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which largely accepts Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we lead , and the bombs we shed on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically un@@ real image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous prints that we are ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly in our news @-@ editorial departments . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to prolifer@@ ate Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global point of view , in which we are . &quot;
&quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot;
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate big territories in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me a cl@@ ums@@ y Muslim today . &quot;
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may lie , where one is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why would I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public presentation four decades ago , scientific of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ conqu@@ erable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ conscious of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president , while he already bom@@ bed broken countries and &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling Initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project apply :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces , where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening to it often means &quot; &quot; listening to these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers wrote their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and their representation are leading to the fact that the audience gets involved . &quot;
they cry out to laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .

Puerto Rico calls for the United States res@@ ett@@ lement of public debt
&quot; on the eve of April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Capit@@ ol National Park , the capital building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( citizens front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the Lutheran Church meeting Puerto Rico . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ fixing of debts have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials who are responsible for the debts must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not to the sovereign territory of the USA - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; is propos@@ ing a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture hosted in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ b@@ el campaign was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot;
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , which has been incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current status or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what did we give up in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; commanded by the military tri@@ bunal in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented herself as insi@@ der of the Assad administration and took note of her alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently transi@@ tions to the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps , none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes were more pres@@ ent@@ able than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras virtually . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything in mind , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
this strip into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet conclude this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other incar@@ n@@ ates to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ clamation that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .

the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the prison of the prison
and I enter in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I wear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I will let another piece of my soul be with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to pick up all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I create myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of b@@ ass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
&quot; Mozambique : due to corruption , director after detention again sentenced to previous post &quot;
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case where a government member after half of his sentence returned to the work station in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was about Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately demanded his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the Prosec@@ utor of the Republic , who rejected the request , there would be no grounds for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedure after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not doing the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the wron@@ g@@ do@@ ers .
&quot; the company , however , apparently was and promp@@ ted not to take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .

&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks moral return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead worked only on the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man , who was previously charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;

&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he energe@@ tically affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of everything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot;

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users to injustice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der b@@ se .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ por@@ ted &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely appreci@@ able con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically invo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ical words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ Kno@@ ck@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the proposition ku la - &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it is to reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before breaking all posts suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write at Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words side by side .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , get a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to share his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned editing , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a lot of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author informed his opinion why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and banned words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among the users . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , to see if their posts are taken off the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that were not contained in hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
only to try out whether Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .

&quot; the post states , &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally raise violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control young hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides , critic@@ ising them . &quot;
&quot; but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than concentrating on code and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is concluded with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the roe deer are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which should prohi@@ bit this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organisation ( IR@@ O ) , gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state should not interfere , since the age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children , who were already married with 15 , amounted to 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movement endeav@@ ouring to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for instance , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition created tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill was adopted against the children &apos;s marriage - despite the four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent person who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country has to agree and announce the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it .
&quot; once approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled , because the laws on chil@@ dr@@ ens were finally changed . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is cloth@@ ed by a minist@@ erial office in the ministry of education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has disgu@@ ised the essence of the matter , but do you know what ? the roe deer are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , stating : , &quot; Out@@ standing News ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly talked about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the change of the sp@@ ouses was decided today , 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote . &quot;
all MEPs who were too against have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ shiel@@ ding .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
heart@@ y congratulations .
thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; yet a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best @-@ known Hind@@ u organization . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law was to be passed , and he seems to have fulfilled his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj would go against the law , most of the social media users wished to address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of discussing the problem , would simply talk about that the state , our daughters used to be ab@@ used to them , would then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws prohi@@ bit@@ ing them . &quot;

&quot; thanks to the mir@@ r@@ oring of web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia @-@ content again &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ Page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright law in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has now blocked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful as well as reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock .
&quot; although many technologies @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use tran@@ scription tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computers ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is available in spite of legal prohibition . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read content on de@@ centralized and distributed mode . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
IP@@ FS also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation and it is just a screen@@ shot and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , if Wikipedia is blocked by Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server sends the request to the correct wi@@ ki@@ pedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a hl@@ pf@@ ul r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to overcome the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know &#91; it &#93; , for he rose from face to face to ti@@ tig@@ ers , saying , &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot; &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to shoot at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of ad@@ ders . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arri@@ vals . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ mp@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women , with the greatest care , avoid speaking the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pr@@ on@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should keep the norm in keeping this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a head@@ court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also by name is also widespread among men . however , they have far less ad@@ mitt@@ ance to fear if at all , if at all , they should not comply with this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , became a unique club and thus became the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage down to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of the change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in its panel discussion , acted by women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
&quot; she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem , with which women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; not to speak lou@@ dly in the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they all uph@@ old and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not observe this , is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned around to me and said I should call him by now by his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some thought it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the crus@@ hing of a century @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never prono@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she only gig@@ gled in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received numerous reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scar@@ ed and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ c@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ c@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed , and I stopped carrying him . &quot;
&quot; the other women did not complete with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , for the first time in her life , she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; she d@@ anced and sang and talked about things she had never thought of before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never spoken so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ty Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothing , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini adorned her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped telling the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and are not other family members . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the h@@ edge for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people talk about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29th June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was staged in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here have become quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . &quot; &quot; 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese medium schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les just survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Winn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese will of course also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base in market terms , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at M@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
this is how the day is going on today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; following the h@@ ash@@ tag , he has taken the course of the course , to learn more about the Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;
gl@@ are @-@ headed men are depor@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that gl@@ are @-@ headed men could be in Mozambique &apos;s goal of attacks .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of public servants for organ traff@@ icking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a shiny man &apos;s gold contained gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC announced . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on glass @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to the fact that the UN 2016 , in the South African country , conducted a mission to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
&quot; bew@@ are of k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique , set @-@ headed men in Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ an police after the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the mur@@ ders were arrested . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ ger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , indicating that the problem is part of the major social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I would like to invite E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE S@@ ICH a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good grades , and who would not hurt others or even take their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted , which aim to achieve quick wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some would not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter @-@ user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed : &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community , after his attorney announc@@ ing at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of the prostate cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State En@@ danger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to treat it abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Li@@ u &apos;s case . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway Oslo
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government informed that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the crew of salmon to China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed its hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she said in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would wish him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he would help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Embassy demand a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to intervene in a single and ir@@ responsible manner on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ly told that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to impose the Chinese government on Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany ( in german )
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u will &quot; get all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns if the whir@@ l around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to disp@@ ose of his family . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ P previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room at the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk and contact anyone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks about :
&quot; Canada demands China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression for exercising these rights . &quot;
France ( 3 )
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds in an Declaration on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news service France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan ( in english )
&quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan requested China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat itself in Taiwan .
the Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took , and for which he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 who stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem fool@@ ish as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ u@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Criminal Chamber of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , and most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; spin the logic &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Shan@@ u@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of that , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re pop@@ s up from author@@ itarian leaders who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Shan@@ u@@ gam gave answers to his American guests with respect to our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system . &quot;
corresponding questions did he tar@@ ry with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , insofar as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; while An@@ on publishes his comment on the blog , he points out regarding the critics that one should begin to read the full tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just choices . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in that sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ u@@ gam who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ u@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes , and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ u@@ gam treat a mistake , or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since it plays an important role within the cabinet of government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ u@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , expands and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we have always been a town / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series to reveal rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to be shown a different fac@@ et .
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question posed by me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; for my clari@@ fication then most often follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook internally with rage when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; American , on the other hand ... &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is supposedly deemed to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you would conf@@ use me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be sp@@ aw@@ ned - just like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that one can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence away with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open @-@ heart@@ ed friendliness that I connect with my American friends meanwhile . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau stepped on the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada real sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop @-@ band in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ ds the Jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes .
&quot; although not specifically political , the music video indirectly refers to the continuing military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it deals with the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has har@@ n@@ essed in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; Change of Creation &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and uncle@@ ar regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors and prosec@@ utes the online content and individuals accused of viol@@ ating the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Rev@@ en@@ ation ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems facing the Jun@@ ta is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; the video shows how people are thrown into a black truck , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society slowly reco@@ vers slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ag@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spiritual cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ni@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are f@@ aded and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were church centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the County government provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; from her daughter , Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ children . &quot;
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they commemor@@ ate the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once stood , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation is drawing to the end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they are running , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies in their lives . &quot;
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; she is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink fr@@ ill @-@ frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in Ted@@ dy B@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez relates , people get into full little bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; mo@@ m Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cart@@ ons outside . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; they also help them and bring them to hospital if they are sick , they buy them medication they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ ghurt go@@ at@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travel with his sister , hoping to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; he says smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they went on to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
it declares that their Christian belief is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; during this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to many African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other inhabitants also open doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova , Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , travellers may consult their teleph@@ ones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves with numerous photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ets , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she briefly presents her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , even in the UK , can be the &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruc@@ ted the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the notification , it is said that the app &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online , and remotely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and the South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority areas such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ uses and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet &quot; Images from In China &quot; published on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checked to check whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from In China &quot; ( Cre@@ ated Mist@@ ress@@ Temp@@ tations ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting in that the software can lift the code requirement of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directives of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also referred to these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a whole series of other possible transgres@@ sions , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and discover that you are alone in a place where everything you need to van@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually been resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both internally and extern@@ ally . &quot;
one that makes all honour to her name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the spectacle , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth moves on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough so that I &quot; learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough so that the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; all the districts sought after , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things settled down somewhat after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we ended up with a gorgeous image , full of my expectations and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low up - nothing can give you your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry if we are not near . &quot;
his filled eyes were built upon me .
and you are wondering what to look in your eyes and not on the floor !
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure about my thing when I said : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father with it . &quot;
&quot; his father , along with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is still in my nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture I was exposed to for months . &quot;
I crossed the court .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I wear with myself . &quot;
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eive each detail exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , this time they have allocated a bigger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; &quot; help tling &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent man of middle age , which looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no significant facial features on me , and doctors are not there ; we are all numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers neg@@ ate his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
a li@@ ar .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ en on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; all@@ usion to 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be inter@@ rog@@ ated .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yers and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played out their con@@ fession@@ al press card and betra@@ yed the close eye view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is no country here ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ ble room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a lean and stock@@ y husband ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ive it : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join these days and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am accustomed to not answering .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly chat for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aking .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold back your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my cri@@ es were not yet enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a gar@@ bage collector earlier or if that belonged to normal labour equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables , in order to present ourselves the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and found no favor at all , which is why he had access to an electri@@ cally charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which occurred to me just like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ fu@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted you@@ ths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry about fear@@ ful sorrow . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps into his canvas , sometimes to his computer , occasionally to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking through borders , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he insi@@ sts on the American foreign policy a special incl@@ ine . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed second generation &quot; - he himself , even if he was born in Jordan , has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sh@@ akes in water dissolved Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the hat@@ ches speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the swe@@ ating of the K@@ ent c@@ ig@@ ars in the nose first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan had cancelled an appearance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual inc@@ it@@ ator Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening .
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MEPs and former spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition called Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returned traditional sex men to the body by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a seemingly rebel@@ li@@ ous unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust . &quot;
in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ our of Hon@@ our &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of men of honour in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan has failed to support the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence , in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime counter @-@ crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; &quot; be held in prison for in@@ definite time &quot; , &quot; and for their release , a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is often necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity , and is known to shy away from themes that have long been tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit requests on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of opinion , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was told politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are political in the core , can be continued . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated many times : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ do@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been extensively cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of context , distor@@ ted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is actively campaig@@ ning for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not engage in Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asked himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so h@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service established several former members of the government and members of the teaching alliance , with the reason that they have expressed critically about the problems rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s show is just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is what H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approaching a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial democracy . at least , he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to bite and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many parts of T@@ oh@@ o@@ us in August . another theory states that the stron@@ gh@@ olds , drums and dancing were mar@@ ched over more than one thousand years ago , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the native people , to their knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to take a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two ban@@ qu@@ ets are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; often out@@ ward appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal to the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; experts face each other to show who you can create the most ec@@ centric look@@ ers , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the bid@@ ding possibilities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school opened special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of its achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community for love with the children . &quot;
Colombia : sec@@ uri@@ tis@@ ation of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel kick@@ ed out to accommodate aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; the two young Colom@@ bian milit@@ ants Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a , from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os , inspired her to the Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación ( L@@ etters to Recon@@ ciliation ) campaign aimed at encouraging young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa war F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the cl@@ ash of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bian people , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; for many years , gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the goal of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who will then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he talked about sharing his love with people this year , which needed the most urgent attention . &quot;
&quot; the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former comb@@ at@@ ants of the F@@ ARC was created . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought anyone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC established themselves as they had previously done to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear up to happiness and everything in between , &quot; the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience like this : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former war@@ rior brought me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed there was a m@@ GL par@@ lance , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life has anyone written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him completely and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
&quot; perhaps he was tired of war , he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard their hearing before and had no right to recognise , and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and have even hated people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give us a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
Colom@@ bi@@ ans have been prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ armament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to take up arms and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all that dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome it . &quot;
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life of Kad@@ y@@ row

&quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ er@@ owa , whose first publication took place on the OC Media website . &quot;
&quot; gay and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terr@@ ors , activists have witnessed the report of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a D@@ amo@@ del compl@@ ains about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community there is not just over night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what &apos;s happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took suspic@@ ious que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender balance of their country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear of their lives , they ultimately moved to the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round of W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I sens@@ ed something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to convert the family , you che@@ que ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten along with everything and started crying .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wing . &quot;
OC Events : in which cases were you laid - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me in the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was only bad excuse , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have body size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only disappointed your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a dark@@ ened window and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give their names any more , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering me , without proof , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in safety , just because you &apos;ve left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , about gender equality we do not speak , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to see how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have been there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Events : are you still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not very many .
&quot; if , then above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , they were deliberately sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this only a sup@@ position , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there was nothing new about them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe that before 2003 I was already well @-@ known when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to bring us up to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back into the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes wore tubes jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has never we@@ pt even one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to be children , when people make fun of the sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but above the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , viewed you once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I discovered these people themselves when I ap@@ sul@@ ated breeding places .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion at all . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no g@@ ays with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an who , the cab@@ ard@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think in transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love males , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact , different ways of life . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ha@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in self @-@ killing . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 declined the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ eg@@ rown hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warned that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all the family F@@ athers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe work due to the persecution of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated disorders , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically prohi@@ bits the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab areas into the Persian regions , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , completing 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process is the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names at the workplace will not be toler@@ ated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activists kill alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; when I say I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists * inside .
&quot; for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old underneath .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift their voices and &quot; &quot; to sing &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries deserve less than white men and women .
&quot; black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background , to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have equal rights of all men and all men of any skin color ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind , which refers both to gender and skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white femin@@ ist party who has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a formal and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural enrich@@ ment in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although sec@@ tion@@ alised femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of campaig@@ ning for a white femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana critic@@ isms : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) by defining ourselves on our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to find out about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment where my life neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on neglected , little respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Kurz@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # far@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the people concerned .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex partner who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena indicated because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , also the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez didn &apos;t use anything . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife left her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , are at all reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that has nothing to do : 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a soci@@ ological research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
the available numbers are al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence took place at the District Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here as well .
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; any woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse is two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since there is no own criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

&quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system , which does nothing &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then after . this was supposed to regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious : &quot;
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; once I read about it , I always thought that only women who are sub@@ missive because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for the long run of Carlos and not left him earlier .
&quot; it seemed almost like they would say , that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not born in Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mal@@ treated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; eventually , her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against her former partner who developed into an im@@ pass@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach to flaw@@ ed implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but cannot be applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ registered ) are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d has to explain to an independent criminal off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ er as already in neighbouring countries , Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; so the text of the law was changed in a number of points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was denied , which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funding for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are punished . &quot;
&quot; we have to reimbur@@ se so long , until ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . previously , parts of the law had been altered . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the filing of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continued to attack attacks in Oman a year after a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities signed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he has a year @-@ old prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dism@@ issed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to its role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the sult@@ an &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public freedoms , including freedom of the press , including freedom of press , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to freedom of the press in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , published in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties bound hands of justice &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of having put under pressure judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS recorded the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ k@@ at took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to jail and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned for dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the pres@@ tige of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j have been sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread the material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 Swiss ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from detention on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dism@@ issed from the Central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to admit Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an instruction to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three additional months and with which the minister once again appe@@ aled against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to restore the publication of the paper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
&quot; other injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Cuban authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2 . creating a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , ensuring that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial cler@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its agreement &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent . &quot;
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he conducted research on the HIV virus , before deciding to go home to support the sam@@ b@@ ari@@ c health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ari@@ al national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; I am also star@@ ing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
what are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always be recei@@ vers , instead of being M@@ acher ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the United States and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research on space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here . &quot;
the system that periodic@@ als can only make money accessible ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the United States since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only suitable for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or card types . based on these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it takes longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river lie a b@@ oul@@ der to which I have to climb .
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand trial , no one can breed any new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in outer space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit themselves to be able to freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the Emer@@ ging Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg insi@@ sts that the &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; &quot; he says and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot; &quot; whoever wants good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to continue to provide their seed to others , as opposed to patent seeds and plant features . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , since the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always more limited . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all dictionary features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; there are still no estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of vision
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired features - from those , by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders through increasingly more patents decreases . however , genetic diversity is more constra@@ ined than ever since the changing conditions are much worse predic@@ tible by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; it contra@@ di@@ cts , however , that intellectual property ent@@ ails other breeders since &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection therefore does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how by the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees that differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ els , there certainly won &apos;t be any innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on , however , is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plants : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do this . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state of Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation is needed mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents have patents , they manage most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; also , Mort@@ on believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , because I know my competitors are selling my grades in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to lead the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot be easily adopted at one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to experience something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch will be scheduled for scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a network of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have the opportunity to exchange and improve their seed policy , thereby ensuring a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon realize it . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

all winners received certificate as a reminder and other prizes such as souven@@ irs with the competitive logo or coup@@ ons for online shops .
&quot; the authors of the 11 photos with the highest j@@ uries , as well as competition participants who were able to photograph most of the objects and collect the most points in the overall score , were honored with the prizes . &quot;
other awards were awarded by other organizations who joined the competition .
&quot; for example , the members of the Hol@@ o@@ iv@@ sky@@ i nature park , which is located in the metropol@@ itan area of Kiev , have chosen the three best photos taken in the park and submitted for competition . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there were also some special categories in national competition : &quot; Un@@ pleasant Discovery , &quot; docum@@ enting the destruction of natural habitats , initiated by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of the topics , with the photos on Wikipedia the best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo were missing . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities were sharp@@ ly critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic network for Human Rights Information remains , in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who were to defend the law of freedom and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . &quot;
&quot; it is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation has fallen victim to the wave of website closures . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to deal with the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ ger , a provider of which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity since he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook @-@ comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs too lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It succeeded in communicating to me the feeling of a si@@ ege , an arrest , an attempt to murder , summ@@ ons at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I took it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave ones go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this gave technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; also , af@@ te documented the locking of vendors , enabling internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content , which could have access to the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in N@@ iter@@ ó@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers across Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro assass@@ inated &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio &apos;s known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August , the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they announce a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything , however , from the civili@@ zed standard , and what happens in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the paper continues : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is located 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was also part of this security policy . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of chic@@ anes and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux published his article from the year 2010 where he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also involves serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week later , it is now that the police have climbed up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ et@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and the surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , have been committed to perpet@@ rating the massacre by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been under si@@ ege of controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to inhabitants on locally produced or caused by tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own Mus@@ h@@ rooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the common foods used in Syria , but they are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; head of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we opted for cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in homes and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and reli@@ ed on his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; fame &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about the cultivation of fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la led to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but they will continue to raise funds on cand@@ o until Monday , September 4 , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in east Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; : si@@ ege of si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( like paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to acquire new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese claim justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the sacrifices of the fires , which were gr@@ asp@@ ed in the week before in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two persons died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state mour@@ ning . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 frac@@ tures spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , some 500,000 hectares of forest are burnt in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in four districts no fire .

numerous videos spread online and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ el of the Bund der Farm@@ ers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated and nothing was ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could happen again , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the forest reform , which the government had brought into serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val results in the same article in the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of light fire@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the protection of civilians from Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when citizens searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative which provided the population with information : it used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was held on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , so that the servers did not stand on the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires . &quot;
even the Fo@@ under asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even never again . &quot;
&quot; in the dawn , the boy should burst . &quot;
his unc@@ le would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ bollah leadership dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar , which were he@@ avier than himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no service and no heating there . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left behind his life without papers in Iran , and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage of the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greek . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af joined Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which distributed twice a day food to need@@ y people . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high protection quot@@ as , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road . &quot;
&quot; thus , it also took A@@ shar@@ af . &quot;
but his ir@@ repres@@ sible lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is an interim solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans have sprung up , including inc@@ is@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the dining menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals , however , range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stands stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey . now , he wants to help other Afghan people on this journey . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : draft law schemes in Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
photo by @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter shared .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ edle report is an international snap@@ shot of challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament scrut@@ in@@ izes a draft law , which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks within six months , users would need to register on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the exp@@ ul@@ sion of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a senior official would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; Egyptian law is already pun@@ is@@ hable under Egyptian law . under the legislative proposal , however , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised Egyptian police officers , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the resolution of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison management of human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison into the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges such as weapons of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ id murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iza was free of charge of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists inter@@ rog@@ ated to le@@ av@@ ed documents
&quot; the Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ rog@@ ated for a le@@ aked action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , who according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that all the un@@ just@@ ly preserved funds will be returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on May 9th , a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations by the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts believe that this elimin@@ ates the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks . it is uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; in the social media , Chinese citizens have proposed to vote only sel@@ ectively to protect citizens &quot; journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat should register as &quot; organis@@ er of information sharing &quot; in the state government . &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law allows the government to take charge of the removal of content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently owned by web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ wie@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru , and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrator refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication provided that the site had been blocked because it led to &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to address a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , alongside other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; following this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance fu@@ gi@@ tives that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
