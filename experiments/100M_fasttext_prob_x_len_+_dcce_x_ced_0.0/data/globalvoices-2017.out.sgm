<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and pursued his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was as if it's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish letter of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his narrow-mindedness."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never lags behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the nominee nominated by the Party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist's program, which takes people from all over the world, is a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps also agreed not to agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump warned his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(O.B.): as much as" "the White and Whiplash" "(white and Whiplash letterplay, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I must think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices became louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, could have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country," "said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cataca?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played at both places, has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a big garbage dump, only 16 kms south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered youth such a rare ray of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cataca - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cataca where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all from the garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local winemaker and teacher of the children of Cataca, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments from reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cataca, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"accordingly, the East African countries were correspondingly upset and less inclined to welcome a criminal criminal of this type on their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were swiftly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, an executive of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of looting the stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and safeguards resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries, which then expelled the prime ministers from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like minded and work together. they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail tag, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, individual countries can exchange existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i tracks the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as suggesting that a ship loads its captured fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the move and possibly, whether they have a criminal liability."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the so-called platform was created to gain an estimated USD 20 million in lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishers entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also, even those illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include such actions as sailing under false flag, counterfeit royalties, specifying fantasies, fish-protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system", "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" You don't want to run my port. ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole now tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has discovered criminal networks that had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found winged ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his co-operation with INTERPOL, the international agency for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to breed suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track the illegal vessels that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO, who also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland therefore helps build a system that combines various information levels. it is intended to help FISH-i, to find criminals acting with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence this unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the ocean protection organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of every single trackable vessel."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - this simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources into the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "the Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used to be confiscated without a license earlier and hardly had to face consequences, now know that they are being observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since fishing boats have more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets there on board, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that other countries now also copy us," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars vanish annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined together for the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "safety is the goal of producing even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "Copeland said."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's recent Membership Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used towing nets which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they prevent illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recovery of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - including Barinas, the Mérida and Táchira national park, located in the central-north of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>

<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the resolution of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the deposition of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum has been considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">"on the military base, I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoner."</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">'cause the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were placed and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I came in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a camp bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">"later, I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the person's body that was lying there."</seg>
<seg id="241">"they often tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there in it was horrific... like a filthy windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that it is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with handcuffs and were able to bind eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian, who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people lie quietly on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you do so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me here?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, there were some rooms designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"(according to indications from survivors of the civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted at La Perla-Ribera trial, the student Raúl Mateo Molina to death)."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, director of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way where the kidnappings came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and were then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">"here, their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from the top came that they should be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war-spoils'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time, at that age I had no idea what the" "war loot" "- as they called it - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, I was in Gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps military badges that one picks up to an enemy that one has fought against."</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered: and you, who drank cars on the street?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against rage, struck me and cried out:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill yourself."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else!</seg>
<seg id="284">That's how my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll-collar pullover of wool. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothing home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense was accused of being a conspiring of this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay hold on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the corpses is the last disgusting act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you were executing people during the dictatorship. but what makes the bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl to the house whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy for them to put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why do their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these people not also had families to whom they could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpses is the last disgusting act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they fetched machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they have been crushing and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." "you will never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something of course always remains.</seg>
<seg id="307">I've seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father."</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him reproaches because of all the atrocities I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I killed anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked me why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings", "which they allegedly defended, were really good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">"you have committed horrible crimes, and you have forced me as a child to participate."</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied," "Well, let me know." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">2010 I received the first ad.</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Editing of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Kyoto Japan city, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licence, during the last month witnessed a very unsuccessful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the Japanese word" "elder motorist" "means" "older drivers" "on a sign, wrongly - perhaps also with malicious intent and # 8212; as" "terrible motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">"Joshua Levine's original photos, shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the invalid English translation was first removed. the term" "terrible drivers" "(German:" terrible motorists ") was later replaced by the more appropriate though grammatically not quite correct term" "elder drivers" "(german:" "older drivers" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are really sorry that older people felt insulted by the insufficient correction (the translation) on our part," the police said. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country, however, is quite an occasion for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1.803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents is total, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the reporter, which is not mentioned in the name, brought comments to the light published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on Yahoo with the translation error, among other things, received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"-" Is this ("awful motorist"), for example, not the reality? "</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the original text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, costs or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations company-internal. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, are made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic propositions, which arise through machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards, careful translation can be expected."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto is hopefully using a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible."</seg>
<seg id="394">"also other online transmitters contributed recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositionists, who oppose the Nicolás Maduros government."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"earlier investigations by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby the DNS servers correctly answer requests of certain domains."</seg>

<seg id="407">"we confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet"</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes their minors son or their minors daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"but what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay innumerable days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criminazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organizations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked to Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collecting testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated to the Criaditas guarantees in general stillness."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crivazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family that their daughter in the belief that they conclude their training, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes care of the girl and justifies its exploitation with the faith is that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive training and perhaps even starved."</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>

<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply involved in the paraguayan society of Criminazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>

<seg id="460">"in the home of her employer, Alvarenga worked every day between four and six hours."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was done with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to go hungry, but didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary members recently voted on a bill to "regulating use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of accepting the law, users would have to register with their right names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months' imprisonment or a buckle."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraves and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that is running through the Internet and is used to communicate with others via voice, video editing and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to apply the registration to the users who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation at the level of social media enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyadh Abdul Sattar, Parliament of Parliament and promoters of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and received a username and password from the ministry of telecommunication to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they were forced to control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and to supply them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" "is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in which the control is maximized and should be ensured that no deviating narration is present on the image surface," "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a crime against cyber crime, in which a life imprisonment for those deemed to threaten the" "public order" "and" "to protest". ""</seg>

<seg id="524">"this post by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the Kurdistan Mountains in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working on protecting the horseful Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards that wanders through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxophone). altogether, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find fewer and fewer prey."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem, "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the free game is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a biologist, Raza likes to passionately reveal another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, Kahou Shimpo, the North-east Japanese daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the life of those killed by the" "triple disaster" "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, tsunami and an atom bomb in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was an etectable prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring Prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had removed whole coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, and already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, the special report of the Kahou Shimpo shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahou Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitutions (wholly-owned, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures. here, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"even six years after the disaster, the evacuation of temporary shelters (who has to be evacuated, kasetsu juutaku) to settle into final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of people from Fukushima, who were evacuated in 2011, still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster were settled in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by disaster, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have moved extensively."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmland destroyed in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land from Fukushima lie in the nuclear block zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahou Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that almost half of the coastal residents have been living since the disaster, making it more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahou Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">"as it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture,"</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-causing nuclear disaster that Japan had ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, something more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into long-term replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the stand of 2017, more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuation centres, which are still in temporary shelters, are older than 50 years old. it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the recovery, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do so by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, Mobile Tonstudios have been offering mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach young songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were run by educators David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked together in Northern Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop begins with the assumption that the young participants in talks like" cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in West Canada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always fluent in the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a stanza in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is at your disposal, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plastic models of the dishes" ") are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">The Tokyo-Ga film maker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago in the Tokyo-Ga cinema.</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they do not even attract them any more. however, a new trend now turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic ribbons decorated mobile-bands as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin cooling cupboards for a new exhibition in Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences becomes increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cell phone stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell with salmon. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile stand has the form of melting snow.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"other skurrile plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter to hashtag # ProceFrontier, which will be staged."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the decoration of the restaurant industry."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the blasts and killed periodically appear only in statistics."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Kartell, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bonding in the hundreds of secret ditches, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "to live with the drug trade" "), which will give this sacrifice a voice and tells stories of people who fell into the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime is not only concerned with our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and that whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (german: "how afraid life changes") tells just these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for every weekend secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is with me here too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but it does not pay them out because they require a certificate of death."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come across newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the perpetrators when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that is as if they tasted those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories become mere figures in a statistic."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "permanent". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to say that they are spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the main city district: how a family has been pillaged by threats. "it describes how armed criminals were squeezing money from their business month by month, but also torn apart their family."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain over it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes back high when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation called by force." ""</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and" "chchi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor had 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mornings per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories are living in the face of ever-new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015 whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has been torturing the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank wagon crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war Africa, Africa's second largest country has been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous pathways full of potholes, which were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"representative representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped, including a cinema nearby, full of people who watched the football world championships."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses branded and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, January 12 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">"it shows rows of charred bodies lying on the floor, while people look at them."</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo has been reviewed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and unfortunately, real, but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 combatants of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns Baga and Doro Gowon attacked.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one remained to count the corpses," "said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be visually displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unanswered, but the military base in Baga had been a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo emerged as it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of misdepreciation; Africa Check has documented assignments in Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments, such as this example, falsify the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were described punches, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported from violence against Rohingya, posts such as the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken by an Saudi Arabian news site, which in 2012 claimed, the President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to capture this information."</seg>

<seg id="912">"this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Boko Haram, published by the news page Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the killings, but it claims that it is a" similar "jihadist attack." "</seg>
<seg id="913">"when the image later fell into circulation in the context of the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015, the paper El Pais tried to refute that there were links to Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="914">"Turkey, 2015." "# NijjeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" "(Nigeria burns, the world sleeps)."</seg>
<seg id="915">"the image of the DR Congo appeared with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris."</seg>
<seg id="916">"they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events, which took place in the name of Islam."</seg>
<seg id="917">"United States, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="918">"the image was weathered for the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retwept). but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison from Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message allegedly written by a" "father Juan Carlos Martos" "about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it a fake."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included, the organization of the Claretin Missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves."</seg>
<seg id="923">"there are other confirmed examples of erroneous use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">"there are two strong themes or frames (frames), which pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion."</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to major discussions about silence in connection with the murderings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the murderings of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo and in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been debated extensively (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"an argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent pictures of readers and viewers desensitize and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something, but which can actually be detached from the context or to completely abusive nature."</seg>

<seg id="944">"a blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not at all to translate."</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobmesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or an expression does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected throughout a period of time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of" "untranslatable" "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT lap language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">Vakasteglok "- Imagine your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi "- The laziness or laziness that you feel after you heated up in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they deplish other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page yet want to publish more of these" insurmountable "words, showing how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are."</seg>

<seg id="971">"triggered by the monsoon, which normally ends at the end of May, the rivers of Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Atanagalu Oya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country."</seg>
<seg id="972">"following an opinion of the disaster zone of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 men were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of floods and sludge winches."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling Initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"recently, Global Voices reported a different initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces, where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening to it often means" "listening to these events instead" "listening to feel, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers wrote their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and their representation are leading to the fact that the audience gets involved."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out to laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his fork, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytellers."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on the eve of April 3, 2017, several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration; the march started at the Capitol National Park, the capital building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"it was proclaimed by the grouping" "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" "(citizens front for the neural examination of debts) and the Lutheran Church meeting Puerto Rico."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-fixing of debts have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos claim that politicians, bankers and government officials who are responsible for the debts must be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find themselves with declining pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is said:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what the real costs are, with which this is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, which has been incarcerated in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current status or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military facility."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police "was based on a" strictly secret "commanded by the military tribunal in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented herself as insider of the Assad administration and took note of her alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently transitions to the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps, none of Bassels cultural prototypes were more presentable than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras virtually."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything in mind, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet conclude this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other incarnates to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a proclamation that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: due to corruption, director after detention again sentenced to previous post"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case where a government member after half of his sentence returned to the work station in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was about Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately demanded his re-setting to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Prosecutor of the Republic, who rejected the request, there would be no grounds for Cambaza to return to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedure after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants are not doing the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the wrongdoers.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, apparently was and prompted not to take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disgusting ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has so massively insulted."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks moral return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead worked only on the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man, who was previously charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief belongs to the prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, not only to remember the Mosambicans as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, incisive and - incidentally, prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he energetically affirmed that" an ambitious human being is capable of everything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to injustice</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or spider bse.</seg>

<seg id="1289">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "Kalar" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely appreciable connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today, 'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmesical words with basic meanings, which have the same character sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalar kaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The FacebooKnocker Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the proposition ku la -" "cure" "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmisch - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it is to reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before breaking all posts suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write at Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words side by side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who disseminate hate speech, get a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to share his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned editing, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post" "didn't meet the Facebook community standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a lot of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author informed his opinion why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and banned words like" "chair" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "Facebooks automatic censorship provided a lot of mockery among the users."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh at Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech, to see if their posts are taken off the grid."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that were not contained in hate speech, but nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out whether Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally raise violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control young hate speech on his Burmese sides, criticising them."</seg>

<seg id="1343">The roe deer are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law which should prohibit this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the inter-religious organisation (IRO), gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state should not interfere, since the age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as, every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of the children, who were already married with 15, amounted to 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movement endeavouring to abolish laws on children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for instance, had no concerns to tell the critics of the children's marriage, they should, to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition created tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft bill was adopted against the children's marriage - despite the four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent person who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once approved by the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"the majority of social media users were enthralled, because the laws on childrens were finally changed."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is clothed by a ministerial office in the ministry of education, said:"</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month, Turkey has now blocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technologies-savvy Internet users are used to use transcription tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users don't fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computers), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"however, the content is available in spite of legal prohibition."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read content on decentralized and distributed mode."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation and it is just a screenshot and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, if Wikipedia is blocked by Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to overcome the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage."</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was and I immediately began to crush pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know [it], for he rose from face to face to titigers, saying,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation. ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to shoot at the Bardia National Park recordings of adders. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalympa and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women, with the greatest care, avoid speaking the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should keep the norm in keeping this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a headcourt and violated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also by name is also widespread among men. however, they have far less admittance to fear if at all, if at all, they should not comply with this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, became a unique club and thus became the main topic of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pahas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage down to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in its panel discussion, acted by women who did not call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem, with which women can easily identify."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak loudly in the name of their husbands, is a custom that they all uphold and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not observe this, is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning Rohini, who had never named her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned around to me and said I should call him by now by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some thought it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the crushing of a century-old tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only giggled in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received numerous reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini thought I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zincberred dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the zincberred dot if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed, and I stopped carrying him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not complete with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, for the first time in her life, she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; she danced and sang and talked about things she had never thought of before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salty Kurta, a wide shirt over a pant, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothing, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini adorned her own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only made small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped telling the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and are not other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the hedge for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people talk about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Criminal Chamber of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, and most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to" "spin the logic" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shanugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of that, he appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre pops up from authoritarian leaders who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanugam gave answers to his American guests with respect to our press, our Judicative, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions did he tarry with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear Mr. Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, insofar as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"while Anon publishes his comment on the blog, he points out regarding the critics that one should begin to read the full transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "as a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just choices. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said Singapore" "be no country," "he obviously did not mean it in that sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanugam who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes, and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanugam treat a mistake, or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since it plays an important role within the cabinet of government, the statements of Mr. Shanugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore, expands and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a town / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" "the defense of the country especially" "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is deemed to be polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"for my clarification then most often follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians may cook internally with rage when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their rucksack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1767">"but there are also some problems with the stamp" "nice." ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "means to be spawned - just like the benevolent, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has his own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that one can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means unobtrusive and uninteresting and not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main part of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders call" "nice" "is perhaps just cool courtesy."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a popular pop-band in Thailand has released a music video that parods the Junta, which seized power in 2014 and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not specifically political, the music video indirectly refers to the continuing military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" "The Dictator" "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it deals with the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has harnessed in the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army that monitors and prosecutes the online content and individuals accused of violating the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"she is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frill-frame and gold-coloured earrings in Teddy Bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez relates, people get into full little busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out:" mom Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cartons outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"they also help them and bring them to hospital if they are sick, they buy them medication they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao Family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurt goatee) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travel with his sister, hoping to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "he says smiling." "we will always stay in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs Ramírez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they went on to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian belief is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"during this winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to many African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through tapachula come from Central America, other inhabitants also open doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova, Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travellers may consult their telephones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves with numerous photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair fleets, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she briefly presents her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, even in the UK, can be the"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they instructed the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the notification, it is said that the app" prevents access to terrorist information. ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online, and remotely control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and the South, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censuses and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet abstentions."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet" Images from In China "published on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen were randomly checked to check whether they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the end-of-the-day technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from In China" (Created MistressTemptations) also published a Jingwang product description, resulting in that the software can lift the code requirement of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directives of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also referred to these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole series of other possible transgressions, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slips into his canvas, sometimes to his computer, occasionally to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking through borders, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he insists on the American foreign policy a special incline."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as a" Palestinian winged second generation "- he himself, even if he was born in Jordan, has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he shakes in water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the hatches speak lukewarm coffee and the sweating of the Kent cigars in the nose first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan had cancelled an appearance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual incitator Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the MEPs and former spokesmen of the Islamic coalition called Dima Tahboub said that the concert was" straight "cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional sex men to the body by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a seemingly rebellious unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years Jordan has increased the number of 'Honour of Honour' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of men of honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan has failed to support the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence, in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime counter-crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can" "be held in prison for indefinite time", "and for their release, a long-term bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is often necessary for the woman to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs's music also enjoys great popularity, and is known to shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit requests on sexuality, freedom and expression of opinion, cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was told politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are political in the core, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated many times:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want" - whether it is faith or non-belief, heterodo- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been extensively censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya, to later note that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is actively campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not engage in Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asked himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemite kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service established several former members of the government and members of the teaching alliance, with the reason that they have expressed critically about the problems rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's show is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is what Hdaib sees. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing" it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approaching a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial democracy. at least, he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to bite and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many parts of Tohous in August. another theory states that the strongholds, drums and dancing were marched over more than one thousand years ago, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the native people, to their knees."</seg>

<seg id="2167">"often outward appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for esthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal to the experienced hands of hairstyles that can recreate these intricate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"experts face each other to show who you can create the most eccentric lookers, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hairdressing art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the bidding possibilities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school opened special educational workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of its achievements:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: securitisation of guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"isn't it much more important, people who feel kicked out to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"the two young Colombian militants Leonardo Párraga, from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios, inspired her to the Cartas por la reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation) campaign aimed at encouraging young people to write guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the clash of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombian people, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"for many years, guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been subjected to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he talked about sharing his love with people this year, which needed the most urgent attention."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC was created." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought anyone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC established themselves as they had previously done to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear up to happiness and everything in between, "the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila told later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former warrior brought me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed there was a mGL parlance, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do they do?" "he said," "I answer a letter which someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has anyone written something so beautiful, so I answer it." suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and set me next to the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of war, he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard their hearing before and had no right to recognise, and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and have even hated people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - even those who killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombians have been prophesied that after disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to take up arms and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all that dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome it."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with terrors, activists have witnessed the report of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damodel complains about the LGBTQ community there is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what's happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ situation in Chechnya has taken over the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that addressed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who took suspicious queens and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had learned about the gender balance of their countrywoman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of their lives, they ultimately moved to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while trying to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no men in Chechnya, who can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round of WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "Here's a gift for you from your uncle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I sensed something in my body, but I did not hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" how long do you want to convert the family, you cheque? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten along with everything and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right pulmonary wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Events: in which cases were you laid - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me in the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to return to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running up through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say I didn't change my sex, that everything was only bad excuse, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only disappointed your family, but the entire Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give their names any more, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering me, without proof, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think you're in safety, just because you've left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, about gender equality we do not speak, this is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to see how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have been there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called" "honour" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Events: are you still gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, they were deliberately submerged to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this only a supposition, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already taken place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe that before 2003 I was already well-known when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to bring us up to" "civilisation", "but ultimately has thrown us back into the stone age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored eyelashes wore tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Sharia has never wept even one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "Spotte not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to be children, when people make fun of the sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but above the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who had laughed and laughed before, viewed you once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I apsulated breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion at all."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan who, the cabardins have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, there is it - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in transidentity to men who love males, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact, different ways of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 declined the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Talegrown hospital in the town of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warned that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all the family Fathers, who felt helpless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe work due to the persecution of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most valuable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated disorders, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically prohibits the Ahwazi Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a large number of dams, the waters from the Arab areas into the Persian regions, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>

<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process is the reason for this."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>

<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arab names at the workplace will not be tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists kill alarm before the situation is explosive."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is an updated version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold underneath.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"nevertheless, everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to" "lift their voices and" "to sing" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with a migration background, to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women to have equal rights of all men and all men of any skin color; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers both to gender and skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white feminist party who has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a formal and marginalized being in a historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural enrichment in order to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although sectionalised feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of campaigning for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana criticisms: Reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) by defining ourselves on our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to find out about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment where my life neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again Nabil Musa traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child," "tells Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we don't have water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, an documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on neglected, little respected subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with which help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" "by Kurztural. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# farlicheinefraubin) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex partner who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another wife Balbuena indicated because of mistreatment, also the accurate display of Ada Báez didn't use anything."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife left her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, are at all reported to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible abuses and a legal system that has nothing to do: 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, flawed implementation of punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really harassed, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a sociological research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads for domestic violence took place at the District Prosecutor's Office. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's ads came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually shown." on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"any woman who is refunded because of physical abuse is two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since there is no own criminal offence in Paraguay, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" "without complicity, no impunity." "photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">"invisible mistreatment and a legal system, which does nothing"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then after. this was supposed to regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"once I read about it, I always thought that only women who are submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for the long run of Carlos and not left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they would say, that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complicity in it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not born in Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was maltreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias everything started with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"eventually, her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against her former partner who developed into an impassable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays Law: good approach to flawed implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but cannot be applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the Paraguayan parliament, known under the hashtag # Porelas (# fürst)."</seg>

<seg id="2588">"medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media, but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases caused by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he conducted research on the HIV virus, before deciding to go home to support the sambaric health system."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the sambarial national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"I am also staring a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">What are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always be receivers, instead of being Macher ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the United States and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">How is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research on space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodicals can only make money accessible (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only suitable for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or card types. based on these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but it takes longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river lie a boulder to which I have to climb.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand trial, no one can breed any new type of salad, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman lettuce of the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to be able to freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the Emerging Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg insists that the" "open-source" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not." "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," "he says and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry." "whoever wants good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to continue to provide their seed to others, as opposed to patent seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always more limited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all dictionary features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it suitable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are still no estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale plants such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of vision</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired features - from those, by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders through increasingly more patents decreases. however, genetic diversity is more constrained than ever since the changing conditions are much worse predictible by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts, however, that intellectual property entails other breeders since" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection therefore does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how by the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expels, there certainly won't be any innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it will make us impossible if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plants:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state of Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation is needed mass herbicides, breeds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto) patents have patents, they manage most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"also, Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, because I know my competitors are selling my grades in a few years", "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition, which makes it very easy for my opinion. ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to lead the" Open Source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the OSSI obligation cannot be easily adopted at one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to experience something about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch will be scheduled for scheduled next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a network of aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have the opportunity to exchange and improve their seed policy, thereby ensuring a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon realize it."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make clear to people that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2725">"the Arabic network for Human Rights Information remains, in spite of this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, who were to defend the law of freedom and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"it is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera for alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ziada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles, which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he set up to deal with the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, a provider of which is also home to Ziadas blog, on the other hand is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity since he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook-comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs too lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It succeeded in communicating to me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempt to murder, summons at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I took it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this gave technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalate."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also, afte documented the locking of vendors, enabling internet censorship and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such a practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content, which could have access to the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these acts."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will they attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the Brazilian army was deployed in the favelas in Niterói, a city in Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers across Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro assassinated" "thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio's known newspaper" Extra "on 16 August, the editorial" This is not normal, "in which they announce a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crime, etc. everything, however, from the civilized standard, and what happens in Rio will be published in the heading" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the paper continues:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and a historic and self-pleasing neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">The state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux published his article from the year 2010 where he explains why the violence in Rio is not equal to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also involves serious consequences for people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost spheres. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer."</seg>

<seg id="2890">"at that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service and no heating there. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left behind his life without papers in Iran, and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous passage of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited island of Greek."</seg>

<seg id="2933">"in order to be able to use social networks within six months, users would need to register on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the expulsion of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament, is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of the Parliament filed a legislative proposal in which tougher penalties for the insult of the President or a senior official would be introduced."</seg>

<seg id="2938">"if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years" imprisonment for the convicted. "</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised Egyptian police officers, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the resolution of the elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in jail for a trial date."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May, because the prison management of human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison into the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan is threatening the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, false charges such as weapons of weapons, illegal assembly, murder and suid murder."</seg>

<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21, published on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation."</seg>

<seg id="2953">"according to new regulations by the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in addition, it is stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required."</seg>
