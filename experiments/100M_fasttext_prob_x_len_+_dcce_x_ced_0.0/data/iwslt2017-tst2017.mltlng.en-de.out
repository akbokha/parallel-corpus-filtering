this is James Ris@@ en .
perhaps you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before somebody had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed down blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if this sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified risks and promp@@ ted it to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whist@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional law , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they disclose . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they have given years that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cracks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can hide ever less .
&quot; instead of breaking and breaking down , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , got his telephone numbers secret , &quot;
&quot; as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit appointment , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret one . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers coming to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet been written when Ris@@ en wrote his book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any standard contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot provide more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology separ@@ ators , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a chance to have mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the next environmental workers who will alert the alarm to the poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks again .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest datas@@ et of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ ul Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already lead to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of chil@@ dr@@ ens days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting for the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ pt away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens will be used by a few , to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it to me like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ z@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are less reports in the US about this matter .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ ul Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we could have a data le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is true that in some US states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator emerged as an African Minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all of us made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers accepted us as a client , and of course none of them was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian and involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; over the last few years , we have seen incidents for greater transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the in@@ convenient facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a courtyard sales . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to the peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; oh , how please ? &quot;
at night I was lying in bed . I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what I saw there ?
a stranger r@@ ack@@ et in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , sh@@ ook my toes to the door and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people , who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , were friends who only waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ready , my ro@@ ommate goes out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could make some money . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and set up so called &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; when we passed our last guest and fell the door into the castle , Brian and I started . &quot;
had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former fellow , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
&quot; so we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one , who is still in comfort , would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one insi@@ sts on the things that one can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ed .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seat ro@@ omm@@ ates .
this sil@@ ently pl@@ ough of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can &apos;t just read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel like staying elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please tell on Twitter that he is the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have imagined with his name only once ; if he had told , wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 ratings which all say : &quot; he can hold very well un@@ locked phones !
how would you feel when you had to leave your cell phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to abandon negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they relate to age and residence . &quot;
we trust the people most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by assessments .
&quot; if you have less than three ratings , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation ad@@ heres to common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell us too much , for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your apartment ! I do vacation with my family . &quot;
how can we create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a demand that was previously un@@ covered . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devast@@ ate apartments .
hosts will have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in the customer service department . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the forefront when confidence broke .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million spent nights had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks based on sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know anybody .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but now simply to name the &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place that one visits , a group there would be more eager to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l quarter , of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital city of Seoul , this project has already started . many parking spaces that belonged to the government were &quot;
&quot; now residents are offered . students who were looking for a home , &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children had moved out . it was started to incub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries alone will be guest in a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why exactly did our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
every time I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for the future . &quot;
thanks again .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ resses , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : Americans think , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people do not speak to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mo@@ m , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan @-@ Fan , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to fit me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only passi@@ vely accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should you do this ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... &quot; Mak@@ es Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went -- as we went in silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I first feared to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; St@@ ays in well lit neighbor@@ hoods , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims congreg@@ ate for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , crushed and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because the people who attacked the country , attacked our country . &quot;
I have driven the anger of people to terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing to ask , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only possible under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks again !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , enligh@@ ten@@ ers and Olymp@@ ians . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces , but not stopping the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to see people of other faith more toler@@ ant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alisation , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their families so that the persons who are terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks again !
&quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u Klu@@ x club with Christianity . &quot;
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main objective of the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she prevented her from joining the IS . &quot;
it was an insight how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we accept more author@@ itarian regimes , con@@ formance , and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : when one reports on trial subjects in which negative about Muslims was reported , they agreed rather to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to expose the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
Muslims use an early warning sign to deal with Muslims .
&quot; we may sense it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us . &quot;
&quot; at the brief@@ ing of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Yus@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said :
&quot; when is such a young man from my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be only im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mos@@ que or are we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , drew my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was filled completely .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembly were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I have collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had had courage and sympathy with panic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with draft , work in a noble mind factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t fool you . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ parcel delivery takes place in our social awareness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks live in front of the audience . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by joining together , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be found at the highest level . e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other star@@ fish , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ field doesn &apos;t matter in what position the optimal position reg@@ ains and the performance can be improved by practicing .
date : 06 / 14 / 2009
&quot; during our research , we often exhibit fundamental abstract questions , which are at the heart of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying devices , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ d@@ der . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with just one worked . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ ater , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ d@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so that it can fly stable , and can move anywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . in order to bring it to the flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it exactly right if you all watch is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ ater is an exercise in Gen@@ u@@ dition , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is always symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its direction .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some of them can be seen in models , the rest is learned straight from the flies . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if aircraft are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise direction .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration is investigating synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for guys like us , wages are in development and creativity . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y cir@@ cl@@ ed each other faster , so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was em@@ itted into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange events at first .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands at us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courage@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase , which improved the recognition performance enorm@@ ously . &quot;
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes ro@@ amed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a junction in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative practice , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ ous dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and out at the arrival of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite handy , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in the case of tones , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which mean a lot to you : &quot;
for the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; right now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally speak the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , we can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies turn very quickly , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key @-@ change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a sort of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; somebody , who knows what he needs to hear , recognize this as noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s talk briefly about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling around one hundred times per second before col@@ li@@ ding . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before possible .
on this path we can listen to the sound and hear the invisible .
much in space we can not see -- practically or in principle -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because they are op@@ aque .
&quot; grav@@ itation waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big Kno@@ b : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own glimpse . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of whom we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes like Lig@@ o they are observing , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists in being as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you are dre@@ aming with us .
thanks again .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear eliminated . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , on an unexpected manner . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the least , calls all &quot; cookies &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; cookies , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I swear to always play with them once you call me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I feel very comfortable . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sag@@ a for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , wake you up to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I am scre@@ aming television . I produce TV .
&quot; I am doing television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for introducing 70 hours of program to the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days four shows four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series conver@@ ge on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so even above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are now a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously if I talk about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just about the computer and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , as I set up troops , as a painting I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one should deliver a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums that I write over writing that writing to me is a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , you do it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I started with television production when I began to work and work , to create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum ! &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what is called sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more episodes the more crowded boundaries , the more work it gives , the more things are watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I made , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sum , the sum , the sum . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burnt out . &quot;
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their M@@ um is a single working group .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine st@@ alled .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as ever : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not exist , doesn &apos;t give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was an indication @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun any more . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; heu@@ l from , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you &apos;re working , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , to be a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the hum@@ ming feels when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late turn and she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of myself : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; cookies . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anybody any more &quot; cookies . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan , and my sw@@ amp is bet@@ tering , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ our , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I made , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pens and the song in which it goes for release , or whatever the girl leaves in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the tit@@ anic surro@@ unds , this is only the substitute . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum depends on love .
&quot; the sum is the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
the real sum is self @-@ consciousness and peace .
&quot; the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a fixed rule , so that I can rid myself of any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice , if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not based on how to work .
&quot; the truth is aching , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at home as at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of person rather works than being at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ attle in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I mostly feel sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always recommend it to my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ e of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the games ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you probably are right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and when my teen@@ y daughter talks with me for 15 minutes , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can get up 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad day ! &quot;
15 minutes by track !
&quot; no cell phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my oasis of well @-@ being , my world . they do not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for his peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it yourself .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll leave and I wins . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a titanium in the training , when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the tot@@ e of life .
sum@@ ming of Love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing for me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan Poker that is going to go to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new attitude towards life in me is broad . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I wake you up to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; they have certainly heard of one of the most known , known &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; an electro@@ de is im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the switching circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with cran@@ ial brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain with the skull @-@ brain and the skull pressure rises .
&quot; in order to save life , one has to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes a part of s@@ wollen brain mass must be removed . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a piece of tissue , is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are imm@@ atur@@ ated cells , which can turn into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they distributed slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral stem cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why did they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells just as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ en@@ rolled it at the collection point of the same individual . &quot;
we call it aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ introduce these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ introduce the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we re @-@ en@@ rolled the cells into a healthy brain and we watched that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ reim@@ pl@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ fet@@ ched .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we injured in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex the hand motor sensors area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontan@@ eously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we implant his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey that spontan@@ eously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we re @-@ en@@ rolled the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multic@@ entr@@ e study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable entity .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ ful that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy f@@ ades with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- will not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are w@@ asting our future and w@@ asting our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the debt @-@ mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the mer@@ ging savings and corporations , which however are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income , with which one could carry the debt collection and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green energy . &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summ@@ its , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , stimul@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him when he grows . &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily brings about the circumstances leading to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus is killing him .
that is my hate with capitalism --
&quot; his most extravag@@ ant kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voice weigh@@ ting in questions of the state bel@@ lows . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long .
&quot; like a candle that shines very bright , it is quickly burnt out . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ day liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only came up as a complete separation between politics and economy , and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our democr@@ acies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , the economy gradually under@@ went politics and depri@@ ved it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not based on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be in the government today , yet not in power because the power of politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hate with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ s the animals from which it nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has har@@ med politicians so far that they are har@@ med themselves by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is increasing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ assemble the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts go deeper , as it is already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we are democr@@ ati@@ sing the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy which makes the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced .
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve people and put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all revenues from capital and of revenue , and the concept of wage labour , are completely outdated . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no stock@@ ing twin summ@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it &apos;s basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not possible to implement the technical means .
&quot; today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is simultaneously liber@@ ating in which it fav@@ ors privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the sleeve of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thanks again .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is absolutely relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
it was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China resembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to put China now , to do what the West did in the 19th century itself sm@@ ells m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ly in hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sens@@ ed that that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continual den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European Group , have still chosen den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to preserve an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it might be a while to delay , but when changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its construction . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the faults that passed through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; no one from the Troika of the len@@ ders who imposed this policy on us was : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not survi@@ ving .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ fu@@ ges will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has an i@@ gel and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon is producing .
&quot; of course , this is a highly competitive industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can not select any .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right corner of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating has been received .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and above , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addi@@ cts where , after watching a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it makes more thoughts about the middle yield , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases stuff for nothing , is it wrong ? &quot;
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they are watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are being watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 , and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of staging a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed with it a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very competitive , data vers@@ ed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
because the logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work this way , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time where we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will decide if a person will be good or bad .
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of experienced companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news station . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked faul@@ t@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly ceased functioning , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy . &quot;
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
first dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the parts ; as a second place you put the items together again to make a decision .
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is a different tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re @-@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , for what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts will put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that wasn &apos;t in the data . &quot;
Ted &apos;s Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compet@@ ed for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This is what the data is saying to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will f@@ use it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not alter the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data is still paying off , making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
