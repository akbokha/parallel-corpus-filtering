<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before somebody had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally handed down blueprints for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if this sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified risks and prompted it to name its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional law, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they disclose."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they have given years that it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide ever less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of breaking and breaking down, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, got his telephone numbers secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit appointment, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret one."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistle-blowers coming to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we therefore put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet been written when Risen wrote his book and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any standard contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot provide more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology separators, such as Edward Snowden, have a chance to have misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental workers who will alert the alarm to the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks again.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest dataset of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does it mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness about an explanation.] this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosul Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mospack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already lead to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of childrens days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting for the next release, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens will be used by a few, to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it to me like a Matryozkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are less reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that these tax havens work, Mosul Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we could have a data leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is true that in some US states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator emerged as an African Minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all of us made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers accepted us as a client, and of course none of them was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician and involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very trivial as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the last few years, we have seen incidents for greater transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the inconvenient facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency that now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a courtyard sales."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said he would go to the peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself saying," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "oh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed. I gazed at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what I saw there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger racket in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, shook my toes to the door and closed my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people, who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, were friends who only waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ready, my roommate goes out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could make some money. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and set up so called "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"when we passed our last guest and fell the door into the castle, Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former fellow, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented ourselves to the investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still in comfort, would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one insists on the things that one can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left seat roommates.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silently plough of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can't just read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel like staying elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell on Twitter that he is the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined with his name only once; if he had told, whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 ratings which all say: "he can hold very well unlocked phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to abandon negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they relate to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three ratings, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation adheres to common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell us too much, for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle art works in your apartment! I do vacation with my family. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a demand that was previously uncovered."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate parties or devastate apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked in the customer service department. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence broke.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million spent nights had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, miracles can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks based on sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know anybody.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply to name the" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place that one visits, a group there would be more eager to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl quarter, of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital city of Seoul, this project has already started. many parking spaces that belonged to the government were"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now residents are offered. students who were looking for a home,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children had moved out. it was started to incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries alone will be guest in a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about it when a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for the future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks again.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppresses, brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: Americans think, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I'm introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern-Fitness-Fan-Fan,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to fit me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only passively accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you fully understands you and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" breaking message. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people spranged out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..." "Jihad...,"... "Makes Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I went -- as we went in silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I first feared to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment this night, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stays in well lit neighborhoods, "" Don't be sampled. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims congregate for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, crushed and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who attacked the country, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have driven the anger of people to terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only possible under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks again!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, enlighteners and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking spaces, but not stopping the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to see people of other faith more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalisation, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their families so that the persons who are terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks again!</seg>
<seg id="342">"the IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku Klux club with Christianity."</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you look at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main objective of the instrumentalization of extremists who spoke to her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she prevented her from joining the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept more authoritarian regimes, conformance, and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: when one reports on trial subjects in which negative about Muslims was reported, they agreed rather to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to expose the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Muslims use an early warning sign to deal with Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may sense it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"at the briefing of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain themselves."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was startled and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man from my brother become such an accomplished young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, has murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or are we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took it out, drew my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was filled completely.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembly were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and sympathy with panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-parcel delivery takes place in our social awareness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre tower of 1,500 bricks live in front of the audience. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by joining together, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found at the highest level. e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starfish, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airfield doesn't matter in what position the optimal position regains and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often exhibit fundamental abstract questions, which are at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying devices, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies with just one worked."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospater, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so that it can fly stable, and can move anywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. in order to bring it to the flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it exactly right if you all watch is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospater is an exercise in Genudition, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is always symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its direction.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some of them can be seen in models, the rest is learned straight from the flies."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if aircraft are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is investigating synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy circled each other faster, so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was emitted into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">"before 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands at us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are formed by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could significantly increase, which improved the recognition performance enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collidiating black holes roamed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a junction in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stout into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative practice, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a really alous dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and out at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite handy, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of tones, it is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things which mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">For the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"right now, Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally speak the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, we can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies turn very quickly, one hears the same circus with an additional key-change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a sort of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard ligo the following: [Surrender sound] somebody, who knows what he needs to hear, recognize this as noise of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's talk briefly about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling around one hundred times per second before colliding."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the sound and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- practically or in principle -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Knob: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by its own glimpse."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen and of whom we have never seen, and of whom we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"indeed, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes like Ligo they are observing, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists in being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You are dreaming with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks again.</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, my fear eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," has changed my life. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"" yes, "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, on an unexpected manner. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the least, calls all" cookies "for inexplicable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"cookies, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swear to always play with them once you call me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I feel very comfortable."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "Yes" saga for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I'm a writer. I think things out, wake you up to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I am screaming television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I am doing television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for introducing 70 hours of program to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days four shows four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts: 24 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series converge on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so even above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are now a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously if I talk about work, so you understand that I'm not just about the computer and fantasiere, and it's true when I say, I understand that it's not about dreaming in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, as I set up troops, as a painting I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, one should deliver a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums that I write over writing that writing to me is a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, you do it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I started with television production when I began to work and work, to create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sum!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you cannot strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what is called summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more episodes the more crowded boundaries, the more work it gives, the more things are watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I made, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the sum, the sum, the sum."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overdone, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their Mum is a single working group.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sum ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stalled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as ever: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a titanium does not exist, doesn't give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was an indication-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun any more."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" "heul from, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you're working, one loves to be a teacher, a banker, to be a painter, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the humming feels when the buzz stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late turn and she says:" mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things become aware of myself:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" cookies. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anybody any more "cookies."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm a Titan, and my swamp is bettering, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humour, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I made, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax pens and the song in which it goes for release, or whatever the girl leaves in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the titanic surrounds, this is only the substitute."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sum is the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a fixed rule, so that I can rid myself of any blame as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice, if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not based on how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is aching,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at home as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what kind of person rather works than being at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rattle in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always recommend it to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the tote of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you keep me naive, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably are right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones don't want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teeny daughter talks with me for 15 minutes, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more do not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can get up 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by track!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my oasis of well-being, my world. they do not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the humming of having a place for his peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'll leave and I wins. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a titanium in the training, when I wanted to outperform myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the humming, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The tote of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">Summing of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing for me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan Poker that is going to go to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new attitude towards life in me is broad. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I'm a writer. I think things out, I wake you up to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have certainly heard of one of the most known, known" "deep brain stimulation". "an electrode is implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the switching circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with cranial brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells the brain with the skull-brain and the skull pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, one has to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes a part of swollen brain mass must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a piece of tissue, is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"it is necessary to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are immaturated cells, which can turn into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They distributed slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why did they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells just as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-enrolled it at the collection point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call it autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-introduce these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-introduce the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we re-enrolled the cells into a healthy brain and we watched that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-reimplated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-fetched.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we couldn't stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable skill level, we injured in the motoric cortex the hand motor sensors area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implant his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we re-enrolled the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicentre study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved doubtful that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy fades with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- will not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are wasting our future and wasting our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit Paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the debt-mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the merging savings and corporations, which however are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income, with which one could carry the debt collection and also produce all the things humanity urgently needs, for example" green energy. ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulate in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summits, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in an endless loop, stimulates the pessimism of investors, which could be true that his son would kill him when he grows."</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily brings about the circumstances leading to the fact that Oedipus is killing him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hate with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his most extravagant kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of Athenian democracy because of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voice weighting in questions of the state bellows."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted long.</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is quickly burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only came up as a complete separation between politics and economy, and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, the economy gradually underwent politics and deprived it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not based on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be in the government today, yet not in power because the power of politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hate with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustains the animals from which it nourishes, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has harmed politicians so far that they are harmed themselves by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is increasing, political goods are being devalued, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism expels the" demos "of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we must reassemble the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts go deeper, as it is already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to transform the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we are democratising the reunified field, otherwise we end in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy which makes the film" "matrix" "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or something similar to the" Star Trek, "in which machines serve people and put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" matrix "-similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: imagine a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all revenues from capital and of revenue, and the concept of wage labour, are completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there that the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no stocking twin summits."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" "the cosmos", "in units of" "Cosmos" "-- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It's basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not possible to implement the technical means.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have, in particular, against the background of a reunited policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberating in which it favors privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the sleeve of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks again.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand what Larry Summers calls" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is absolutely relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you think of the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I may say that provocatively, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China resembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to put China now, to do what the West did in the 19th century itself smells mightily in hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to the self-sufficiency, and the continual denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Group, have still chosen denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to preserve an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it might be a while to delay, but when changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its construction."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the faults that passed through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"no one from the Troika of the lenders who imposed this policy on us was:" "this was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone is not surviving.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the liberated centrifuges will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"most never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an igel and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technique, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon is producing.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a highly competitive industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right corner of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating has been received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and above, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that make addicts where, after watching a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"it makes more thoughts about the middle yield, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases stuff for nothing, is it wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know that they are watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4, and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of staging a competition, he and his team have looked at the available data on Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," "House of Cards". "Netflix has landed with it a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competitive, data versed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least what you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work this way, this is something terrifying because we live in a time where we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will decide if a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news station. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked faultlessly, year by year, until it suddenly ceased functioning,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">First disassemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the parts; as a second place you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is a different tool and we all possess it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to re-assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, for what they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts will put together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that wasn't in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted's Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they competed for TV ideas, then chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say," "This is what the data is saying to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a little more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data is still paying off, making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
