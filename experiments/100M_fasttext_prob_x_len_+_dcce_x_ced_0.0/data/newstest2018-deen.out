Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are supposed to meet today . &quot;
&quot; a grave chapel , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the erst@@ while ground of peasants .
the oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it anno@@ ys if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everybody who had to get upset , because the car @-@ nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very revealing . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering rug that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; maps , so @-@ called ur@@ anium sheets , were incorporated into the large picture map for cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originate from the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
&quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country , and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes . &quot;
&quot; even though the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of a nationwide b@@ awar@@ ia card . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot;
the document for Munich origin@@ ates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of former / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , thus 1877 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , you see nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ eup &quot; , &quot; from which the foundations were derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots yield no farmers there today , but farmers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the site of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the territory of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or the height &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with del@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich @-@ based district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to apply force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Rot@@ ary Clinic in Haar &#91; 1905 &#93; . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per Clinic Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , you@@ ths now meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - in architectural borrow@@ ings to the original building of the Irish institution , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once again on the Mari@@ enhof , where these days will take place and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn regular route will take place . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group releases Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union to Promot@@ e Color has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and be noted here , &quot; says the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult for people to win discri@@ min@@ ations , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that are di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to make travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people pass .
&quot; they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such frequency that we haven &apos;t heard before .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring any deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest human local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in view of the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;
fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U parliamentary deputy Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac acquired a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the pi@@ azza of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs met . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV president of Fischer@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; elementary &quot; important . &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably operate on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , a lot of things must be handled with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he did not lead a bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of their support
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; thus , the disclosure area is 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted by half of the total amount , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss : &quot; here , the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Ro@@ ads Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes it possible for the state support of f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
pre@@ condition is the presence of a grant provided by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be sl@@ ug@@ g@@ ish ( slope slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ une project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the storage area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes on the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ des Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took up a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the pres@@ idency &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not grasp the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of owner and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he picked up its importance , and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta appe@@ aled , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he form@@ ulates it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the vibr@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your arms , / your afflic@@ ted masses who long for ex@@ hal@@ ing , / the el@@ ending waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA were not welcome .
&quot; this conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America . &quot;
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of her death - knew very well that she took a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
&quot; Laz@@ arus modified this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that the American flame is bringing into the um@@ nach@@ ted world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the path to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the importance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ ending but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and that of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to recognize .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not illumin@@ ate the path , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black hon@@ ors Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish ath@@ lets think that it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h did quite naturally were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 S@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the medium @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir takes on this path and last year established five British and two European records .
&quot; it will participate at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which was to be observed after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell team .
&quot; the Captain &apos;s captain saying they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to podium . &quot;
as for my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship .
&quot; so it is really important to put on this home support , and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion . &quot;
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there .
blocking critic@@ isms on Facebook : do not engage in a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the natives of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he appe@@ aled to criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we will be led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Go@@ ose employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ ends it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ free head for chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is considered officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p online .
the Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely cour@@ te@@ ous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other recent news , &quot; wrote in the comment section of the news &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are considered by some rather as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s employees designated as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; would probably call other &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical items and to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but exactly that just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was the last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County inj@@ ected the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of letters struck on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led next door in the Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry did a great job when he set this place .
he is an avi@@ d suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player home in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot;
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we always cher@@ ish .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the promotion on homeland . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad that the time has come .
&quot; with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary st@@ aves through passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attribut@@ able to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is much hiding underground in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a major problem for the building tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off locks is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the line buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ment in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , washed hands and dev@@ oured . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as dresses with mud water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 p.m. , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and includes foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea entered the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rented car . &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo and corrug@@ ated roofs , which were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort completed the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 to almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s ancest@@ ral high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 70s became genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Are All S@@ elling &quot; &quot; is said in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ bane from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro @-@ envel@@ opes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week occur@@ ren@@ ces happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have intensi@@ fied , since Pap@@ ua resources produce a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economies stem from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling h@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; You said . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers attacked her tone and later came back to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired up into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting arches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in a circle and im@@ itated a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started to sling stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; it is said in an official TIME Document which has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him .
&quot; the Che@@ et@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ st@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to the Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only after the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the establishment of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a withdrawal when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he has no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the United Nations was accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence @-@ vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims have opposed such claims with fier@@ y dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he caught fish in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers that responded by firing a warning .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the involved officers to account and withdraw the police brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an im@@ print for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by cont@@ acting spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten town . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is also out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of international media coverage remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were depor@@ ted to Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although they gave them rare permission for fil@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ using and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take this notice .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; in accordance with a source that also participated in the session , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai pleas@@ ures , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai gun sacrific@@ ed a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years that is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire @-@ fighting units exchanged the fire at 4 a.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 p.m. GMT ) , and cooled the building . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , outer cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said they believed that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winn@@ ings was not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also therefore highly valued five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition so well . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was just missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
I will continue working on improving the application .
&quot; not only for the vote , after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal was already in front of the proposal to leave the finale at a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next year in the following year .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements for training work@@ stations etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey out &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously prohibited objects are applied to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore prohibited knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had late discovered that they had been mistakenly using fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people , conducted by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Charter , Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents stated that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent M@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items which were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the company said it was survey@@ ing travelers across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gled goods had brought sm@@ ug@@ gling goods by the airport security and how many would have done it inten@@ tionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the security , those who most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids they may take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
&quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for its new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; the El@@ on Mus@@ k is available . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has previously under@@ estimated that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures on sales increase and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will first reveal another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery is just starting . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k now adm@@ its : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders 6@@ 3,000 had already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that they are only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; &quot; Booking of Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be a problem so far . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be taken together - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to greater delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent un@@ happy customers from running out in flocks . &quot;
EPA @-@ CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the postpon@@ ement of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ induced air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities more respon@@ sive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous job in a German Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran for states on October 1st to comply with o@@ zone standards for 2015 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was president of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been forced to block or delay regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the mandatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane lec@@ s . &quot;
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to adhere to the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set up the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; authorization to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new constitution of the o@@ zone rules .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the Six@@ th Benef@@ it Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische verdict : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; &quot; the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; the wor@@ ding of the certificate was based on the Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the former parish church , which belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age law and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town @-@ picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the majestic settlements of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval property law .
&quot; a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a pastor , remained ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly to this church and could also inher@@ it this self @-@ church . &quot;
&quot; in connection with this , the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two moun@@ ts at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , window pan@@ es were in@@ laid and the bell wed@@ ges were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops enc@@ amped in the vicinity of the church .
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and the church , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hel@@ arius ch@@ urch@@ yard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was dem@@ ol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the steep@@ le and half pl@@ ung@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower building still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is arranged by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the village of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers expose the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen feel particularly committed to their home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the rat . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim Revi@@ ved &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the city border of Schwal@@ m@@ tal there was a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy for the remaining urban area . &quot;
&quot; these zones are meant to prevent a &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , a few days earlier , but the district government in Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a form inf@@ alli@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore with@@ drawn , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided to re @-@ establish the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; appro@@ ving the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind energy plants is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them for the occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
&quot; however , they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ family households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the l@@ wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies with terrible accident
&quot; one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning , at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) . &quot;
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more persons were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police indications , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch drove the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
&quot; the business administration and municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the inhabitants of the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the &quot; &quot; War@@ rior Family &quot; , &quot; Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers to what offers its own town off the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship positions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to &quot; Mid@@ night Shopping . &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets the inhabitants of the city and the region .
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed p@@ ouch , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
urban administration and business bever@@ ein cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this marks the start of the trade and the city into another stage of the &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; project .
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ known event including Sunday , talks with all the professionals and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the city center shopping at a glance .
&quot; at the end , everyone would have to contribute to anim@@ ating the city center - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , King began to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network of le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen informed that the third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thuring@@ ian towns . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the guidance of the Chamber of Commerce and its many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
&quot; a first missing , later , was also found dead . &quot;
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as a result of mis@@ fortune , the authorities assumed working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people were found in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump translated after sc@@ anned tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scri@@ ptions by telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump challenged En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to speak publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President deno@@ unced him because he had deno@@ unced the wall public . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; this cannot be said to the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ ptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the United States emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; &quot; bad , &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would let him look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man of middle age in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the in@@ mates moved in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es tore the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this horrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only one night . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everybody in the audience che@@ ers out very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens &apos; rights come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were f@@ elled by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever indic@@ ted for the murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps to organize the night . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 year old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia , and a lifetime of civil rights . &quot;
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we obtain justice . &quot;
a court physician establishes a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI acts , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the pre @-@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ bed according to the FBI of the black color monitor Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore didn &apos;t come from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they approached from prison and approaching Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the Mor@@ de , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and hiding the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual performance of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , which many want to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and still more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne , because we are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done .
&quot; rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest Black - pushed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to get this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ aving away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona inv@@ ades the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ t@@ ingly one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N Word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are sh@@ outs , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a sorrow , stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holiday mour@@ ning pra@@ ising &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ as de@@ pressing moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his te@@ amm@@ ates and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats about the night @-@ up with a black pair which they have just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling the performance left . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called Police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court yard at his table , he e@@ ats and re@@ members citizens &apos; rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ creation is in a certain way inspir@@ ational because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , he who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat it . &quot;

&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their year of volunteer work .
where everywhere ?
&quot; amount : usually in Stein@@ furt at the furniture market , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I already worked at school in the open full day .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I did Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , we say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focus maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
isn &apos;t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you do the FS@@ J .
you can do it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different from the Civil Engineering degree ?

there is always other people who have a completely different story .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been brought out of the family , one always has to go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , a lot of kindness . &quot;

Pear@@ son pl@@ ung@@ es more 3.000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company has to face . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , in which already 4,000 vac@@ ancies were lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in a third cost @-@ cutting program to revi@@ ve a business , which was hit by the fast step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence hit by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by Nato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the wounded are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ bin killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant assault of the country , since the US @-@ led troops killed the Taliban in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence empha@@ sizes the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump suggests to increase the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA turns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule following coll@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has taken a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said that they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA director Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to assess the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , where inc@@ isions must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , aims to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA site says that inhal@@ ation of air that contains o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community plan wants common room
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ parties , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln takes the establishment of a shared space in the future sen@@ iors community . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still be until the area belonging to the church community has hitherto been owned by the church community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion on a shared space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council ho@@ vers to fores@@ ee such a communal space not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ority @-@ righteous dwelling , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget is for@@ fei@@ ted last autumn , by means of funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a shared space would be , thus , T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal is to signal the investor that , in this respect , no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs want to throw him out , determine that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ing - which reduces the height of the load and makes the building more economical - possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addi@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the board . &quot;
it is not as simple as it comes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela Ruf refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one does not move so much , but now you can rest in the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am very hard to do with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger den@@ ies itself absolutely for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the area there is no grant , but will get a real , in the case of doubt , in a market@@ able equivalent , is the counter@@ f@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; sta@@ ad &apos;s proposal to acc@@ use the proposed proposal , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; so there are two votes in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; if we make the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road

the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder made the road , he obviously did not notice the return traffic . &quot;
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .

FC Bayern Munich must ref@@ rain from David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel managers , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund as the first compulsory game in the new season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the kno@@ ck@@ out winner .
&quot; before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30@@ pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel managers at the German football record winner Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must abst@@ ain from David Al@@ aba in Du@@ eling with the BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Mr. Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 people , divided the German So@@ ccer League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
hiking in the Harz Mountains by Star to Star
&quot; in the resin , the country@@ wide first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; is planned . &quot;
there is a planet of planets in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for many resin go@@ ers , called it . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
members want to place boards along the route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star path is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path the viewers experience a lot of things worth knowing , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is far away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when to see it best . &quot;
the association has been operating the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the centre of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; often , from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot;
&quot; since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet path . &quot;
&quot; starting in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Pl@@ uto degra@@ ded Pl@@ uto at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale from one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measuring 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the Plan@@ etary path is just four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Pl@@ uto requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to welcome the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Fe@@ ather@@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said : &quot; &quot; how are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair for photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans want .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23rd September . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans were asked for him , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he could possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stopped with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks , the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ verside watch out very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which arose for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the fight which needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four viol@@ ins after the tire runner
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information , the driver had lost control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 h before the connection point in the marketplace . &quot;
&quot; the car drove to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident zone . &quot;
&quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; three @-@ circuits works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zes the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season of the season , with the result also , because not the two opponents were against Braunschweig on 2 : 2 . &quot;
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to watch better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ cycle should also be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a breach the for@@ tun@@ ics don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ dimensional chain after the experience in preparation .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we just have in the three @-@ chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we do not harmon@@ ize even better and we do not perform as many play@@ fulness in construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann will go to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak after an un@@ decided start of a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can d@@ ull with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; the start into the season I only judge after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an adverse weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a he@@ avier and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior distributor of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland become an easier choice on Sunday in the encounter at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stup@@ idity , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot;
&quot; making such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ old applications published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for ensi@@ c medicine ( medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started conducting tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take the assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for mistakes in judging the correct age of some refugees who were at the age of age . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; maybe 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been rated for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ adet ad@@ ored the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly stated that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ ray imaging of Wis@@ dom teeth and MR@@ I images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency however defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Traffic and Transport in the Government Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three renovation need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1,30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a side fixing , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian prec@@ inct will proceed .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger @-@ tip @-@ feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the Flat@@ mark in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the costs for the three bridge operations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so often that parties are pulling in one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , which else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the chal@@ k volcano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ del invites to the &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the parliamentary election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D players , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the town was plan@@ ed under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well Square , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forums A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great as many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; rustic potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , which shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcano ei@@ fel has reported that he made an effort for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ schen not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : at about 8@@ pm there will be a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the Rh@@ en@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ person Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; about 200 listeners in the hall are waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep her speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ conc@@ erto tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both unite the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; un@@ ites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz solo trav@@ eller N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games blend into an intri@@ gu@@ ing overall artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the programme was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite in grilled che@@ eses , I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most famous relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ aya , who ultimately went up bitter . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ ures vis @-@ à @-@ vis the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with anyone I had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten announced that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so I have never confused or imp@@ eded me .
I only liked it not to be taken seriously .
&quot; she especially suffered under &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but at school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think myself , &apos; Girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain her love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some may call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gover@@ nor@@ ances and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , cleansing message , &quot; said R@@ onna President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot;
&quot; the global leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ising on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
Russian Athle@@ tics chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been grab@@ bed by cont@@ ests gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the Repor@@ ter . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re@@ deployment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and prohi@@ bitions are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for Mali St@@ ored Sol@@ di@@ ers
&quot; during a funeral service in the North @-@ H@@ esse Fr@@ itz@@ lar , some 1000 people in the two killed soldiers at a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
&quot; to the un@@ educated fall of the fall , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they called the two inver@@ ted drivers , but as &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons &quot; &quot; of their profession . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the members of the family were standing in arms to the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and s@@ cour@@ ged . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann took up the flight operations of the Figh@@ ter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six Tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; no doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance for a country , of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral ceremony the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish King &apos;s couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already produced a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen , agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , was further in the communication . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also sets the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - neither after death , said L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the head of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
&quot; while his later wife interrupted the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a severe stand in the Dan@@ es in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik has been critic@@ ised for the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk spre@@ aders instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swi@@ ft re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign for a swi@@ ft re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the parliament voted for the resolution of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens from its Sunday faction in Lower Saxony threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ voice majority in parliament against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; group leader , Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler , wants to welcome his group to record her . &quot;
&quot; so CD@@ U and F@@ DP have together 69 seats in the lower @-@ Saxon Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new parliament will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable , however , that the state parliament decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide for further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament draws the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be reviewed legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally reasonable .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler named T@@ est &apos;s step , but a little curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it described itself as an app@@ endant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ o@@ oned de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their country &apos;s state .
&quot; we of course assume that she has received her Land@@ tag mandate , which she has received about the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said the Provin@@ cial Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We regret El@@ ke T@@ westen &apos;s decision extra@@ ordinarily . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to speak a pr@@ on@@ unciation in the faction . &quot;
&quot; also against the background , that there were no content differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
&quot; SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor , Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Members El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; the behavior of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Social Democrats of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Parliament .
the exit of the west costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; in their desperate vanity and fru@@ stration of their own personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised Chancellor &apos;s Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony collabor@@ ates with this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to strike out political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U fac@@ tional head Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his MP El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 country election with a personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens at that time , but had a very thin majority of one vote in the Parliament day . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from plast@@ er@@ ers , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) and answer .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if according to all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; in spite of this , my house has immediately interven@@ ed and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same responsibility as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are bu@@ oy@@ ant and health @-@ safe .
&quot; if the total hardness of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not transport@@ able . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the companies are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production facilities do not meet any immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damages due to alleged illegal practice of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
is it only lacking in the personnel or in the key competence ?
it was just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent enligh@@ tenment of such events and the surrender to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can exist are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to exclusively secure safe and transport@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ elled means are manufacturers , retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ fed animals is unacceptable and must be immediately termin@@ ated . &quot;
at all levels it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure .
I am waiting for all authorities that the atomic fact is promptly and un@@ brid@@ led .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
&quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
financial Fair Play Rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
&quot; with certainty , PS@@ G can make money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar signed and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruler of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they have to counter@@ act with legitimate means of income , which allow them to break the break even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to the monitoring of its losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tough@@ er issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; for sure , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for billing of the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum of € 4@@ 4.4 million for the next five years can be exp@@ elled at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to out@@ list their financial supervision by bl@@ asting their revenue through companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar through payments from the Organization Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors will be easy to find out about such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to take care of any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finan@@ ces a society . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has made chocolate for the Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline will write the order anew .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request by the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaging panels of 14 grams are distributed every year before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss government did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
&quot; as many applicants there is at the new tender , the Swiss will not disclose . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
chocolate bars distri@@ butes the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had delivered chocolate tablets together with H@@ ug . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled by the conf@@ ection@@ eries Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is also distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business as well as in Economy Class . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the sket@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ ehler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by climbing up at the heart of the g@@ ags - actors of middle age play hor@@ ny children , who will grow - still manage the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the gra@@ vation back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more to the shooting principle , including a riff on the stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point vo@@ iced a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the grac@@ ious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now novel@@ ist , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot involved in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ ner &apos;s signature of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental ins@@ anity that could hei@@ gh@@ ten this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I &apos;ll consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; on Amazon meanwhile reminds us of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West Ring@@ ed I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director indicates a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ tuned Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one . &quot;
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re @-@ edited on a smaller length , could better supply its Ag@@ it@@ pro @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can do anything to feed a nest .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator was not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against Dru@@ gs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in beating the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday morning the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , were searched for numerous objects , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday . &quot;
15 Appe@@ als were arrested at the age of 25 years and 77 years and already issued an arrest warrant against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials placed greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects of Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
&quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , experim@@ enting murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office has been investigating the organized drug trade in the Southern German region . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the Grand Prix was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian citizens with a close relation to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia came back . &quot;
&quot; another incident on May 27 in Hü@@ ls , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
fashion compl@@ ains large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner responsible for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the register of foreigners . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to partially serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the figures , 10 million people with foreign citizenship have been recorded in the register , including about 5.7 million people from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by around 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been adequately maintained , data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data inputs can slow down revers@@ al processes considerably , &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are also EU citizens who don &apos;t have to leave at all in statistics of a paid people . &quot;
&quot; however , such false ordin@@ ances led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with tax@@ pay@@ ers , &quot; it is said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has apparently started sending refugees back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is said that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF introduce such procedures &quot; &quot; to families with children - except for inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers - from Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU @-@ State is responsible for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant immig@@ rate to another EU country , this state can send it back to the en@@ rol@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send back refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ person of the lef@@ tist faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights illegal detention conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach have already provided the blood donation service for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , who have been awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; first of all Jürgen Co@@ il , who , with his now 100 donations , now distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the municipality appreci@@ ates multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingen@@ ious as our bodies are laid out for it , and we declare respect for the don@@ ors that make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ or helps several people , &quot; explained the director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the c@@ anned foods are crushed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and received 50 blood donations each year . &quot;
&quot; half as many authors Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times a 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; sl@@ ug@@ g@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members raising an increase in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they indicated that in the coming years , interest increases would be necessary to grow the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC GDP , GDP ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continued to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; scale than the markets expected . &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphasized that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell in accordance with these news from the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars , and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the increasing expectations of a interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor increases , since tigh@@ tening will first become worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; prevent income from income &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which compens@@ ates for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shock@@ ing EU vote , which caused sin@@ king of the ground . &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy fully .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said it was expected and will be attracting again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the bank said that over@@ writing in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak Po@@ und . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks very good for those in which the existing deals are running out and closing the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the high court against financing the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that prior to intercourse , pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to be eligible for the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations being taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in the risk of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals , appropriate participants will be identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is specifically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted and vulnerable people are targeted , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we cor@@ di@@ ally welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; said Ian Green , President of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delayed and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ atively this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely refurbished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne Stau@@ space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine , where one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , to resolve the issue . &quot;
&quot; the steel mill is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units provide space for all the ir@@ ons and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can lock up the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you move the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something completely amazing .
&quot; indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave it . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers survived four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the largest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family established jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for US $ 85 million .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city district , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two @-@ thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property valued at EUR 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem to Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul asser@@ ts , has ruled it . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues , this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian hei@@ r suggests that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ ons of the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter . &quot;
Col@@ in held back very restra@@ ined although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire is the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not want Paul and I to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he still hopes for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new chief of staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps of White House that he wants to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed with unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him , &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaigns officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise . &quot;
date : 06 / 14 / 2009
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaign officials don &apos;t know what we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets without their intervention would contain even more ignition .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his employees manage to keep anger from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has been consistently able to prevent Tr@@ ump from causing contro@@ versy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , always attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that potentially promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dil@@ ection of the advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons to supply du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out where these originate . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for Sch@@ ik@@ anen , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked her . &quot;
jump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped . &quot;
the police throughout Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , evidence from the population is hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le hiding places are hiding places , it was called by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 Post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online votes have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them on the basis of evidence after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , which have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn from the church to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were kick@@ ed out in May without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging that was excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their invasion . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be forced into action by Sch@@ am , since he was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ wealth , if the Council cannot stop this . &quot;
&quot; an inhabit@@ ant who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the figures have increased this time , and one has even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for Soli@@ hull &apos;s council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to enable them to move as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many local residents as possible notify the police as much as possible by calling 101 . &quot;
this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
Alp@@ ir@@ sbach in the Black Forest near Freuden@@ stadt is known for its beautiful monastery and its internationally acclaimed bre@@ wery .
&quot; from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will take place . &quot;
the house at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; with the closure of the Birk@@ enhof hotel by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 over@@ nights per year were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then not un@@ disp@@ uted in the municipal council .
&quot; however , especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald was defending the hotel location , and then spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , with its head office , Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof on a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof has been building waste containers before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations will take place . &quot;
&quot; the floors were dem@@ ol@@ ished , blank@@ ets partly removed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; very cosm@@ opol@@ itan &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer puts it . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the performances of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; less than a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the outer systems are also brought forward on the front , which is clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special issu@@ er sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury following a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Board recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling upon the persons entrusted to it . &quot;
the paper considered the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has wi@@ dened and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the station CN@@ N reported that there are already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps Ga@@ el@@ em son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a longer time to have targeted themselves in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigation shall be several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans during the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump has moved into the centre and investigate whether the President in the course of the affair may have ham@@ pered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
Grand Jury &apos;s main task is to test this evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether it is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the count @-@ chambers .
&quot; most of the times , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
&quot; according to the transmitter CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps Ad@@ vis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were involved in the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US TV that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that if necessary , he would act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the founding of the Gre@@ mi@@ um was the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the issue gives Democrats a chance to &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
&quot; these work , however , usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House supports all measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; manner .
&quot; the former FBI chief , James Com@@ ey , told three times that it was not to be determined against the President . &quot;
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it meant in the declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this suspic@@ ion , accus@@ ations were viol@@ ated against Tr@@ ump , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; comm@@ enting on a Senate committee in June , Com@@ ey asked him for setting up investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and its staff . &quot;
the b@@ illed spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; unlike an independent special issu@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the late president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idency of the President of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators proposed bill dra@@ fts on Thursday , which could no longer be easily dism@@ issed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the west Ant@@ arc@@ tica , a gigantic ice @-@ mountain of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the shelf . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ haven of Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tril@@ lion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large Kol@@ oss now travel to the north and probably will need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , according to research data is uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; for about 30 years , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice @-@ cream in the region , writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus had so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ kal@@ ns lies south of South America almost at the head of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; in the north of this pillar , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Shel@@ ter was crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m talking a lot about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C bell file is in danger , because the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the sl@@ ab is under tension and can be broken , if at a key point a piece ab@@ rup@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and displ@@ ace ice as much water as it emerges after melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ice sheet means that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only in a small measure , writes the British research project for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ file is the fourth largest shelf of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic with nearly 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the fur@@ th@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f will again grow or go back in the long term , and possibly collap@@ sing , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not rec@@ ede the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , however , in the past decades , however , many ice @-@ sn@@ aps of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart . &quot;
this long pinn@@ acle of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; over the last 50 years , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus ranks among the areas in which the temperature rises at the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to be a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U requests from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been linked to the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have left their first working day . &quot;
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously highly sought after .
some 620 applications were recorded for the places that were to be found this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now want to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future oriented of the application scar@@ city . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and involve an education campaign , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , there is a high number of employees who divor@@ ce sick or age condition@@ ally from the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he recently ordered a fist @-@ thick surprise in the day of the day , when he publicly questioned personnel costs and aston@@ ished the remaining parties . &quot;
people want all the possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the local employers association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should seek a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; this means that the CD@@ U , the employees and officials , is trying to pay better than the tari@@ ffs for the public service actually envis@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently dict@@ ated exactly , increases or more money is only when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew worked effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself on detailed alleg@@ ations by the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue area , &quot; the organization said in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the occupation of din@@ gh@@ y migrants is on board , which are supplied to them directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected to sit down over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board who monitor their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or han@@ di@@ caps &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti in the meantime said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharp@@ ly , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and the cooperation with the local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; for this , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; once again a look@@ out point at a look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot;

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium healing br@@ ine .
also Neustadt was contro@@ led .

&quot; in the future , sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than being swe@@ ating through the stadium racing at wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high commitments . &quot;
these have also recognised the first federal alli@@ g@@ ators who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire quite new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; it is certain , &quot; &quot; that on this train there are still a lot of associations . &quot;
&quot; the FIFA World Federation FIFA will host the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; next weekend , in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs sought to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be far more often present in these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA will be fo@@ stered at a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , they have long since established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games , e @-@ sport is part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport at all ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly getting used to the most . &quot;
&quot; Ingo F@@ rob@@ bers , too , has long been confronted with the question . &quot;
&quot; e @-@ sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , because he is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that you find in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive abilities require a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ rob@@ atics , however , also pose problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes increasingly a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing . &quot;
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments . &quot;
sales in three years will be 130 million .
there is little difference against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already far@@ ther .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e @-@ sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , a lot is happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga club according to Dut@@ t is now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company with the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
you can &apos;t cling to the fact that only football remains as it was .

Michelle Carter condemned to suicide because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy wanted to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced to death by Conrad Roy in June , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is uns@@ atis@@ fied .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have um@@ med Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; however , Jud@@ ge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor could read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not pray for the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything . I try , in spite of all my pains that we will bear for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; prosec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew up national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , stab yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you must do is switch on the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Carter looked attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she would benefit from the fall by any press .
the case dealt with the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder on her British ro@@ ommate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter is worthy of compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain for the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup Win@@ ner - Extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself a hur@@ ried band@@ age to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner tells the winner after his first deployment as a Bayern captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ me .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f who had been invited by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from the holiday . &quot;
&quot; sugar l is best distributed to those , which one wants to trust a lot , which one wants to keep in the mood . &quot;
&quot; those who have been chosen to compete with the hei@@ r of L@@ ahm , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field . &quot;
&quot; at the right side , this is his position , the white band@@ age in the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ me made me feel like the one who can take the helm , too . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to steer the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the view for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
&quot; V@@ idal there@@ with to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folded hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , to dev@@ ils , come out of the services of the Asia journey ( also caused only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not neg@@ atively arise in their first appearance in the Bavaria tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran right next to Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ itated sover@@ eign@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known n@@ aph@@ one storm was often difficult , in addition , addi@@ cts tried a few times in the set @-@ up for a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y indeed admitted that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he too showed a decent performance in the debut .
&quot; game si@@ ege , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also brought up . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to a few cris@@ p testim@@ onies in the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what goes down here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is demonstrated after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region refer to T V inquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time appro@@ ve the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; bis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest cal@@ am@@ ity in the infrastructure policy sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the building is supposed to be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the v@@ est of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says CEO Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees a sign in it to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as suggested by Wis@@ ser , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wein@@ exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new Master @-@ Bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a prize of € 1,000 is planned for the completed master examination and 2500 euros when graduates of ten years are self @-@ employed after the master training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , but at the same time it lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing at state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied so far . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; s &amp; D Group vice @-@ president Christian Bald@@ auf uses calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 less than 20 million euros less in receiving country roads than suggested . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the former broad@@ band construction in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;

&quot; Audi is said to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announces on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described enterprises as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen ox@@ ides , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles , also take on what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rej@@ ecting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; companies attempt to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called ab@@ using devices to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but for normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after the authorities charged Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be heavily poll@@ uted : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the win of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los boy n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most scre@@ amed carto@@ on@@ ists , the n@@ oses of his figures are his hall@@ mark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he was among other things , as an artist for congrat@@ ulation , which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 60 &apos;s , he achieved a breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches continue to find a lot of dis@@ sem@@ ination worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; the main protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favorite animal in his drawings - that has an exchange @-@ foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he rather puts on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert at the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , which in the spring brought much less rain and in the autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has effects on the service life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil not only attracts tourists but it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ ce meet normally on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest Chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the Repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while throughout the country the bodies he@@ ap up , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under state protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ ator of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deeply even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 to treat the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists has initiated only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; like most mur@@ ders killed every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; in Fe@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are uns@@ atis@@ fied and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very fool@@ ish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we trust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing about Val@@ dez as silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the most bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country since riv@@ alling fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that anyone or several people in Sin@@ alo@@ a will be shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug @-@ kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of tranqu@@ ill@@ ity if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alling cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed v@@ ein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was that Val@@ dez could not force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Fe@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the nar@@ cot@@ ics problem , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave up will@@ ingly that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce team Miss Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with h@@ ug@@ s and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gui@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love of the routine be his destruction ?
&quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best , and to stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home@@ ward run@@ ways and run@@ ways , to deal with drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who referred to the Gover@@ nor himself as trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce has spread to three main stories . &quot;
&quot; there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker , Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a . &quot;
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the government spending , concentrating on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group which in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the public prosec@@ utor , carried out a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities . &quot;
a repor@@ ter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers would have looked at Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and stick@@ ers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few notes and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der than they have written down in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of choosing journalists and bringing them around because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a &quot; &quot; society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note , allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ slava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug traff@@ icking is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a number of found@@ ries with band ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the on @-@ board channel , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phones . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern called me to send them to the streets . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received , that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find that its sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the dying of ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs that was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rus which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amaz@@ ement researchers , which describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he was on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ossi@@ l , discovered by him , was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably threatened by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed him to get better into his surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ ors , through his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter@@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure through meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ ored the deteri@@ oration of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable as loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous have to have been , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on hints about his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with counter@@ balanced skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and preser@@ ves the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous Age was a time when giant thermal episodes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , which stood on two feet , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them who lived Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he was on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the padded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips hanging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin cr@@ ates still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; the remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales in his sole &apos; .
in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re long st@@ alls - and g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , at 17.00 hr@@ s. between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ ming@@ led . &quot;
&quot; at first , there were no data on the exact number of injured persons . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot;
a large range of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the place of accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of driving direction in Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long rear @-@ traffic was formed . &quot;
&quot; like a AZ repor@@ ter reports , it also occurred on the counter @-@ train to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade marked the hall@@ marks of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ bars which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident zone .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just an ingen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ted or k@@ is@@ ses the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
tickets Check .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
&quot; at the moment , a test operation runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we wi@@ pe it out . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available in many other long distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; it is also necessary to have bought the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button will appear for the electronic de@@ valuation . &quot;
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the driver arrives at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without a ticket control through our train crew , checks in the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Management Board . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who are often rail , know that in addition to delays and missed the ticket inspec@@ tions are among the greatest eras . &quot;
&quot; for often , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents required for de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or ID card or otherwise a document you have to assign .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or lar@@ yn@@ ge@@ al space and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after arriving in New York City , the host@@ ess of St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which she rented and scroll through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets via people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his rif@@ le and scre@@ amed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the people &apos;s point of view , who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a cau@@ lif@@ lower and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; the black experience and the black state many times before this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you , when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different str@@ ata of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the luck of giving her an experience in which she personally experiences no gu@@ ile racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l arrived at Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came Fer@@ rel@@ l into the mind : &quot; do you want to document , or do you try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt &apos;s in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for so I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that in the movement &quot; not around a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - she proved to be the most obvious candidate in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ara &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay men in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , based on the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , have marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media . &quot;
&quot; black , gay men in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the news security cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ist links between the municipality and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway in a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers are discussing bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the topic hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the remaining businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot;
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always gladly again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall res@@ ett@@ les in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of it in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is cheap . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , as the rentals there are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty stores there is almost no more and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmer &apos;s market hall going on during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery actually arrives .
or does the gh@@ ost bit @-@ gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; this simply won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre , which is empty , does not need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market is damaged , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ notic@@ e@@ ably similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st con@@ stru@@ cts a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she openly publi@@ ci@@ zed diplomatic noti@@ fications about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ bl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans @-@ wife , and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg embr@@ aced the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from M@@ anning and created out of the 30 portraits , how anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but spoke openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was op@@ pres@@ sive , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Self@@ ie , in which M@@ anning visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the big success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; therein , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ ug@@ s and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o , who would have fores@@ een a future in which the president would transform the judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama is actually just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid divisions which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning called for their super@@ large signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) an end of &quot; automatic disper@@ sion , based on sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in pencil - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the involvement of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully be taking is that our gen@@ ome will not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , The Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot;
she shows M@@ anning how she pop@@ s up with a free @-@ talk @-@ ef@@ on in her hand from the United States Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they put your words together , then they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ants , who are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were searched as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to mur@@ ders due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several engra@@ vings . &quot;
a warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives investigating the engra@@ vings as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
since 2007 La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them has now been abandoned and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ person at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any conceivable manner .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he insi@@ sted on susp@@ ecting the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Mr Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; however , Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was uncle@@ ar whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ Rec@@ tor Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA @-@ timet@@ able was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s timet@@ able for compliance with the code which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to worry about for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the dop@@ ing approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , and then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by WA@@ DA from conducting dop@@ ing checks in Russia .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Manager Olivier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
this divided the company groups .
&quot; it was a pure precau@@ tion , it could further be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been demonstr@@ ably tested on fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lice . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce hair care company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to offer specific groups and demographic groups , and in some cases allow whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to deal with the C @-@ Suite leaders and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap poll@@ s and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognise bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; the Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies can send &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its staff poor@@ ly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of staff . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously identified by executives , which were sitting in offices in cities or states , can be identified and addressed more quickly such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 when Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed because of ethical violations due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; in February , Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in finance in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured a total of $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors gain ren@@ di@@ ties when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise to increase engagement and commitment of the staff , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company don &apos;t take any action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointment and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company , who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; If you really belong to me ? &quot;
to take care of it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported , so saved . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday the company always gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose businesses . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .
some have extended their jer@@ sey @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final exam after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning .
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and she actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already completed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times carried out practical exercises .
&quot; they should do 18 exercises in August . 20 , before the beginning of the formal match preparations for their op@@ ener against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he support the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the player &apos;s busy routes . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ e@@ ze themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is over , what has been abandoned in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that already cleared a protective net behind a door@@ post , will not be easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people hire a room there and then adjust there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking space 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ verification in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook intends to send more potential articles with fake reports from third parties and display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect potential counter@@ fei@@ ts and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors , which may possibly display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the issue has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual re@@ vis@@ ers are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continued to test his feature for the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy sitting in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at someone &apos;s hand@@ writing which has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer , and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb impression on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; letters always smell to smoke , because at that time a fire lit for light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ b &apos; ) all this is too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the hom@@ este@@ ads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with landscape care , gardening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust has only received full access to 2006 when the last experience , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ o@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that portra@@ y who was saying : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on broader base in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ver@@ Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit Pat@@ tern , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed in the 18th century by staging his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a gig , getting debts and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to promote land@@ locked . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique cri@@ b experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium of the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the closure of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ en@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Honne@@ fer , we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , she stands in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; for an average five @-@ digit amount , the city of Bad Honnef serves its new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pensions and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this is how this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the pres@@ idency of the Council of the Heads of Government now also the five Vice @-@ Rec@@ tors and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ size . &quot;
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the General Staff of General Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air@@ strikes and the n@@ avy were dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als in 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , will be exp@@ elled in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the attempt to overthrow it as a &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan has really a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness in the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ scarf ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Grand Master of the Army and the Security Force continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent by decree further 73@@ 95 officials , including 23@@ 03 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they put on their role as guar@@ dians of the world@@ ly state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a particularly well @-@ known officer who sought asylum from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not allow Nato to become cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by issuing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the migration of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate route for racing car shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months over the future of the racing platform has been cont@@ ested - now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , it is expected to be built on the annual route on which the tourist railway drives . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the gate utt@@ les in the long run , construction work on the track should be started again this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; stated Minister Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route cost around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thuring@@ ian rail@@ ways as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; thus the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be scheduled to be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the race @-@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by enough people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it
&quot; just as you thought it won &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we have to start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot accordingly to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would let a st@@ eppe @-@ woman look progressive . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ bot@@ ix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality to suit your personality as much as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ missive female features , the all@@ usions to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most . &quot;
true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator on his website but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men of course will not keep sex robots , and while FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the br@@ ink of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not odd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is however a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Serv@@ ant &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Spe@@ eches of 2017 : maid
dr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of sound human mind
&quot; it has become a binary of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
there were newspapers around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving in the United States about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all are supposed to make our fil@@ ter@@ bub@@ bles burst .
&quot; less noticed , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it is noticeable to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the imposing effect of its pres@@ idency has the strength to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that his bi@@ b will not be abor@@ ted one day . &quot;
&quot; there is however an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans on the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness once compared to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occurred to a very mild criminal off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump is about , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ousel , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals are twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - most dark and the clim@@ actic music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magic experience , as two years old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which it is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was transferred to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; due to Mor@@ des , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 when he shot them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al in@@ tru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; the National prosec@@ utor &apos;s authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

&quot; as a symbol for the dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes were elected under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken yard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken from him broke up , and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain and weak@@ ened . &quot;
after that the classes presented three and four in the rehear@@ sing of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .

Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting ordered the Federal Chanc@@ ellery ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but not yet called a precise date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write to any person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long should the change@@ over@@ s move altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the hangs from the involvement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can it be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE reveals to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions are threatening .
&quot; in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the A@@ ce advis@@ es to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first r@@ apper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scri@@ bes . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and will participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series , thus already announced to ref@@ rain from participating in the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify their views . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after the former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city alive
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the job is already written - however , appropriate applicants are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city builder . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he convey@@ s in the press brief@@ ing .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is aston@@ ish@@ ingly that there is no application for the requirement profile so far . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; according to the regular periods of notice , it is said that there is still enough time to be involved . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ Building Authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must assign corresponding degrees to the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizens &apos; clos@@ eness is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good atmosphere between authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in over 30 years in ministry , some important projects have been gathered , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city alive &quot; , &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz approximately have stum@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
sty@@ li@@ zed for a city builder of great manoeu@@ v@@ r@@ ability .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted quite flexibly to many .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the creation of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what &quot; fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the wind@@ y Stadt@@ bau@@ meister empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the City Builder is carrying a high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going through my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to be buried with Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed course of studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction planning and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; municipal building office is subordin@@ ate to civil and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ employment opportunities , administration of urban properties , municipal operations with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ är@@ t@@ ner@@ ei as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on pi@@ pel@@ ines thrown : road block closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike onto the leader@@ ships in the area of the Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and search for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the scene , a pink sco@@ oter and a bicycle rac@@ er were witnessed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a region of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , had brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay set and the costs for rail transport , also the rail@@ ways of the rail@@ ways could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , to go out of a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten people were killed on Friday morning , two of them survey@@ ed the distance . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall off , but they were delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meter overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US in the USA causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; whereas those affected usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food cannot penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes more toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system is also beneficial for people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was however separated , which was not . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ biology of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome l@@ acked and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria looked on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on imm@@ atur@@ ated immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in genes in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. Cross . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; Genie &quot; , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup kick@@ ed against Real Madrid on Tuesday and impressed as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched to Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been exp@@ elled from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve ahead of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; to meet three of its four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had used such ads before .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD chief , social democratic prime ministers were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; merely no bon@@ fires from the party centre , merely no head@@ wind from the federal government - thus was the most important wish of the constitu@@ tive war@@ riors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus has been observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , wouldn &apos;t have been described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot;
there were low@@ cases .
and one after another .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal @-@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can not be reli@@ eved reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U General Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens MP has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the country &apos;s election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has asked El@@ ke T@@ westen to give her Mand@@ ate back to her mand@@ ates .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the choice of voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen needs to return to her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the federal executive and election leader of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; that must not be true , &quot; a SPD leader si@@ ghs , when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ b@@ ans reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the emergence of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen combined with CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional peak of a whole series of great and small crises in SPD state feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med up at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this was then also - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to tum@@ bling , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks afterwards , comrades , the comrades were struggling again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had made new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit was coming from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next grav@@ itation .
&quot; mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communications he did everything wrong with what to do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW emissions affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the minister of Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents more and more in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz , too , remained un@@ covered . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , since they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no guilt in the party @-@ party constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony @-@ Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz at all .
&quot; meanwhile , comrades , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is intoler@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen places her own career in the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; not because of her individual as a direct candidate , but by the country list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , Mrs. T@@ westen has been elected to parliament , so the lower @-@ Saxon parliament continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters agree four years ago : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony Social Democratic Party to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding funds for town core III
&quot; who wants to repair his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of the ST@@ EG urban development informed about it on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities .
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there has been a feeling of rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy remained at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , not only to develop new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one received the information from the Pres@@ idency of the Government of Karlsruhe that there will be a refurb@@ ishment zone III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ bly . &quot;
how does a refurb@@ ishment work come about ?
&quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue to investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area of interest there is interest to renov@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could then shift again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EG agreed on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be applied object @-@ related , that is per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey would take place only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionn@@ aire to fill out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the stat@@ ute should be carried out as possible , so that the restructuring can be started next year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each Commun@@ e had to carry out the predicted preliminary investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is about evaluating and deciding the disp@@ arities of the urban planning , and to decide when will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
&quot; for the respective property , it is also inscri@@ bed in the text@@ book for the respective property . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ tivities again and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it is concerned with the construction and renovation of the building . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; information about size , division and inhabitants of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if the premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ tsch@@ pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of the funds according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes . &quot;
you cannot reserve funding fees for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; local nucleus II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; pal@@ atable &quot; &quot; refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets up a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its Bio@@ Te@@ q company . &quot;
&quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to the medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House decision to fly a n@@ avy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that canc@@ els American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s data , which have been left to the TIME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was placed next to a boat from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his super@@ visor , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on the South La@@ wn on July 17th , and so long it remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was ev@@ acu@@ ated this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
&quot; from the records provided by the TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal officials to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you were closed , &quot; answered the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - which shows products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn around the US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; made in America &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential supporters . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget of defense , the Do@@ D refund for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a GR@@ AND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also include costs for fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former White House press spokes@@ man , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , was defending the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things made in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud of contributing to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ ou@@ ted with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
&quot; at the end of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga , the runner @-@ up of the Baden @-@ Baden Bundes@@ liga takes place at the runner @-@ up in Su@@ chs@@ dorf . &quot;
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ straße Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has at least respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always played in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially at the post@@ erior position , I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , imports from the high North are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ zz@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us . &quot;
&quot; you need a good portion of luck , too . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , which is currently still playing the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; the Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo , previously un@@ defeated , was on the ball yesterday with the White rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball . &quot;
&quot; he should also be involved in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the Club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also go back to the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking list in January 2016 , does not fill someone out of the trainer around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay to the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he continued his signature under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , the Congress did put together a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors are concerned about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea region North Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the dr@@ one is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; looked at what the Group could turn off , and what could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the spotlight on Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from above . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vill@@ ains of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of the world &apos;s drug traff@@ icking : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) comm@@ its her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal will return as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian investig@@ ative authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1 September .
roll back : the city sets up 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch itself again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
&quot; on the 1st of September , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still cooked except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh Gek@@ o @-@ ch@@ illed .
&quot; the city operates 46 children &apos;s day @-@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children at lunch time get a hot meal . &quot;
&quot; in the last Kit@@ ay year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for about 45 weekly hours , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay at 2 : 00 p.m .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from September 1 : they heat the incoming food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , propor@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the workers are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides on the hourly level .
&quot; the chefs now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
this is why it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen counter to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign lending for the city than the most economical . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the area of education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be real representative and credi@@ ble when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
&quot; the Taliban released threats against a election process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international fighting action to an advisory role . &quot;
this year elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; Mr Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a union wants to wi@@ pe out the long @-@ term commitment to production in its factory in Glasgow over the long @-@ term commitment to production in its factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was weighing over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which alongside other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; first experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; to express concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not promoted . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Region of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , Glasgow &apos;s eastern end urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we cher@@ ish the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we fully appreciate the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operations change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga will regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not ref@@ rain from trig@@ gering an offer of £ 189 million to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City in 2014 he was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti early this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to tear down under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter re@@ mounted and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator inten@@ tionally dism@@ issed a sco@@ oter in the royal fields in front of the estate number 30 and caused damages of over 200 Euro at the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
&quot; for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police seek witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the console . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the city center of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger approached him on his road , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Tour@@ an driver touched the console . &quot;
&quot; in the car , material damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident . &quot;
the police now ask for witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the poll@@ uter &apos;s vehicle to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under tel . + 49 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; report reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen will continue to provide discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are a church , &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false estim@@ ation of what was happening . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that in reporting on violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( &quot; &quot; double measure &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the enc@@ ro@@ achment in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was striking , such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of interpre@@ ting the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ out co@@ ater . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; strikes were a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about abuse of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the commemor@@ ative band &quot; &quot; Mein brother der Papst &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment to Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion , the punishment for the students was also more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to many other alleg@@ ations , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , Ez@@ ek@@ iel explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reli@@ ed on his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence on protective devices at the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became pal@@ p@@ able when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was musi@@ cally not top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ever occurs in it . &quot;
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; you can , at best , repro@@ ach it , learn from it too late , or have first hints not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger gave a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who supplied the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to rab@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he was not only fl@@ ank@@ ed with chairs and throwing the keys on the floor , but also drew ear @-@ sla@@ p on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; in his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced it in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of whether it &apos;s not more of his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just fallen on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him still work eag@@ erly . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put some involvement or knowledge in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claiming to have entrusted to the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; said a sad@@ dened representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even confi@@ de to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a leader who would have been con@@ scienti@@ ously a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questioned student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he would have had timely insights and would have been able to stop the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is reck@@ oned to give him ... boys in@@ sist@@ ent or clearer or even more opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; that students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed during the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to talk from each other . &quot;
&quot; however , he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought it to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; was to be read . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed with a huge det@@ achment of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly chann@@ eled and pain@@ stak@@ ingly suffered , all gathered at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with those he had nothing to do with Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this was , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; Prim@@ ary School &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently dev@@ our ears before the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points this out , &quot; &quot; that the test penalty continues to be practiced in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as testing pun@@ ishments were banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , it took place in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows still . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the persons concerned were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always had looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the death penalty of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is asser@@ ted , yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards for the time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are historians talking about the &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , nor for what was left in the pre @-@ school of resist@@ ances and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all horrible and I am glad that it is finally worked up .
&quot; but at the same time I must protect George R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ thy ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he was strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played back in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of test penalty also available ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells us from his perspective , that the cathedral spar@@ rows played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I didn &apos;t mean that he led a rig@@ orous reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism without the request of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons alone one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I learned Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , ben@@ evol@@ ent , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , of which one could not imagine that he could only do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with him , as many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his gradu@@ ation , regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to which she is still looking up today and which she is down@@ right . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly : everything that one repro@@ aches to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
