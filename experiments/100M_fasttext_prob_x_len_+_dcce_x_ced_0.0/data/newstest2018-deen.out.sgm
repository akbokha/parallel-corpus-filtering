<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"a Irren-Anstalt, where young people are supposed to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a grave chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the erstwhile ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everybody who had to get upset, because the car-navi took a green meadow instead of a bypass road."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering rug that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"maps, so-called uranium sheets, were incorporated into the large picture map for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian surveying management, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country, and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: today's neighbours, who created the idea of a nationwide bawaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The document for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, thus 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called" "Ureup", "from which the foundations were derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots yield no farmers there today, but farmers of the plant" land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the territory of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "Gasteig" "or the height" "On the ventilation" "- but also in big letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich-based district-Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüfte" "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to apply force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Rotary Clinic in Haar [1905]."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 the Isar-Amper Clinic Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, youths now meet in Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected - in architectural borrowings to the original building of the Irish institution, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "main square" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once again on the Marienhof, where these days will take place and on April 5, 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn regular route will take place."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group releases Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union to Promote Color has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and be noted here," says the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for people to win discriminations, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that are disproportionately to minorities, prompted the group to make travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that people pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted or killed because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such frequency that we haven't heard before.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring any deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015 Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest human local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further racial profiling in view of the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidecaun project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliamentary deputy Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac acquired a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the piazza of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs met."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many kittens and houses the Feriengäste in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV president of Fischerbach, he described the fence project as" elementary "important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably operate on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, a lot of things must be handled with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not lead a bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of their support</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the disclosure area is 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted by half of the total amount, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss:" here, the best food is produced. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Roads Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes it possible for the state support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Precondition is the presence of a grant provided by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be sluggish (slope slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherman Weidezune project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the storage area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes on the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdes Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took up a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the presidency's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not grasp the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of owner and liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he picked up its importance, and in particular the meaning that was attributed to her as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta appealed," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factual right, but as he formulates it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your rubbish, your arms, / your afflicted masses who long for exhaling, / the elending waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps USA were not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">"this conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America."</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of her death - knew very well that she took a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus modified this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatives that the American flame is bringing into the umnachted world:" Lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the path to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elending but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not illuminate the path, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black honors Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship cadres will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlets think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh did quite naturally were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Sots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-distance runner Muir takes on this path and last year established five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will participate at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which was to be observed after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Captain's captain saying they are" enormously proud "to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this home support, and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking criticisms on Facebook: do not engage in a public office if you cannot tolerate the natives of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the newspapers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he appealed to criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we will be led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Goose employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defends it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-free head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is considered officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hasserfilled people who swing online the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely courteous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other recent news," wrote in the comment section of the news "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are considered by some rather as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's employees designated as" "concentrated spam" "would probably call other" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical items and to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was the last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injected the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters of letters struck on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>

<seg id="214">"the English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour."</seg>

<seg id="233">Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year," "said Dr. Heiko Becher."</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994."</seg>

<seg id="240">"in the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than presumed, as there is much hiding underground in the underground, which is not mentioned in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">"traffic, which always hinders the construction work, represents a major problem for the building trupp of the company Stumpp."</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut-off locks is already enormous," says Heinze. "</seg>

<seg id="250">"in her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regentment in the unquiet Indonesian province Papua, the housewife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally as" nota "- directly in the fireplace."</seg>
<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the charred tuber is taken with zealous, washed hands and devoured."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as dresses with mud water from the nearby swamp."</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.</seg>

<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 5 p.m.," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up for independence from the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and includes foreign journalists or legal guardians."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua New Guinea entered the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">"the trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a morning 5-hour drive with a rented car."</seg>

<seg id="276">Papua demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goans and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">"according to activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been raped and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969."</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas's ancestral highland in the 1970-70s became genocide in accordance with the Asia-Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="279">"in the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year."</seg>

<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">"the little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals."</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is also out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport."</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless easternmost provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa-refusing and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papua.</seg>

<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the paniai pleasures," says Gobai, Chairman of the tribal Council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" guilt "that he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gun sacrificed a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of Tumlin to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische verdict: count Hermann von Sulz sold" "the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the Vogtei" "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"the wording of the certificate was based on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, which belonged to the church or the patronage law and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the town-picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the majestic settlements of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from the early medieval property law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a pastor, remained steadfastly to this church and could also inherit this self-church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in connection with this, the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two mounts at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over in 1942 during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), window panes were inlaid and the bell wedges were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they removed the pulpit and the church, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Helarius churchyard also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm broke the steeple and half plunged."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower building still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="494">"the organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>

<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had already decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette, a few days earlier, but the district government in Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a form infallibility."</seg>

<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person has been rated for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules aimed at preventing unobstructed spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play Rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"with certainty, PSG can make money loose so that Neymar signed and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruler of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they have to counteract with legitimate means of income, which allow them to break the break even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to the monitoring of its losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"even though Platini has fallen from the Presidency in Ungnade 2015, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off from excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"for sure, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for billing of the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum of €44.4 million for the next five years can be expelled at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outlist their financial supervision by blasting their revenue through companies that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar through payments from the Organization Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar's World Cup ambassadors will be easy to find out about such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to take care of any attempt to bypass the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no pre-preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a sales of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year are still to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymar's arrival a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot purchases."</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members raising an increase in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they indicated that in the coming years, interest increases would be necessary to grow the inflation of Brexit and it said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammut business package issued a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC GDP, GDP (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continued to burden consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, they repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat greater "scale than the markets expected."</seg>

<seg id="1278">"" "the decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the increasing expectations of a interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% has risen to 0.3% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor increases, since tightening will first become worse before it becomes better."</seg>

<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak Pound, which compensates for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused sinking of the ground."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy fully.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the bank said it was expected and will be attracting again in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the high court against financing the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that prior to intercourse, pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the assertion that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be eligible for the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations being taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in the risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in hospitals, appropriate participants will be identified to agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is specifically used, recorded and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust), said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted and vulnerable people are targeted, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We cordially welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"said Ian Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delayed and hesitating implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne Stauspace and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine, where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, to resolve the issue."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel mill is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the irons and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock up the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineering art went in," "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight so that when you move the door, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"indeed, as Joanne, you could decide to not leave it."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family established jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for US $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city district, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul as" "main operator and the dominant personality" "described in the family De Lutis - about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property valued at EUR 316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem to Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"on Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul asserts, has ruled it."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues, this is not true, but raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heir suggests that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>

<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first Jeansons of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says he started Westco when he was" "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to her sons."</seg>

<seg id="1382">"only Colin replied by SMS to say" "I really can't say much" "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father did not want Paul and I to end up in our current quarrel," "he said, adding that he still hopes for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in president Donald Trumps of White House that he wants to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television reaches decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidat Trump was annoyed with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him," "said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to hold Trumps's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaigns officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials don't know what we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets without their intervention would contain even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees manage to keep anger from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been consistently able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, always attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that potentially promotes their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisers, the president for strategic reasons to supply dubious information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials say that Trump is able to react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he can find out where these originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February when someone malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh to be" the source behind a heap of leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for Schikanen, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accusations in the past and revoked her."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Jump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">Alpirsbach in the Black Forest near Freudenstadt is known for its beautiful monastery and its internationally acclaimed brewery.</seg>
<seg id="1445">"from the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise will take place."</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"with the closure of the Birkenhof hotel by the then Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnights per year were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which ensured controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was then not undisputed in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, especially Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald was defending the hotel location, and then spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group of Luisenhotels, with its head office, Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof on a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"they are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building waste containers before the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations will take place."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were demolished, blankets partly removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "very cosmopolitan" "later, as Thomas Scherer puts it."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>

<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer stresses."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so shaver."</seg>

<seg id="1476">"the outer systems are also brought forward on the front, which is clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. special issuer sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Sonderermittler Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury following a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the Board recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling upon the persons entrusted to it."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper considered the step as a sign that Mueller has widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already the first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps Gaelem son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for a longer time to have targeted themselves in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The focus of the investigation shall be several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special issuer Trump has moved into the centre and investigate whether the President in the course of the affair may have hampered the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1489">Grand Jury's main task is to test this evidence in possible interruptions and decide whether it is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the count-chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the times, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the transmitter CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps Advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former leader Paul Manafort were involved in the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US TV that the suspension show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he would act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the founding of the Gremium was the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the issue gives Democrats a chance to" feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he didn't know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"these work, however, usually work in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House supports all measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"the former FBI chief, James Comey, told three times that it was not to be determined against the President."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it meant in the declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this suspicion, accusations were violated against Trump, he wants to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"commenting on a Senate committee in June, Comey asked him for setting up investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and its staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The billed speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special issuer of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the late president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the President of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators proposed bill drafts on Thursday, which could no longer be easily dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the west Antarctica, a gigantic ice-mountain of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has loosened from the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhaven of Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometres large Koloss now travel to the north and probably will need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, according to research data is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"for about 30 years, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice-cream in the region, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus had so far been part of the Larsen-C Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelkalns lies south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"in the north of this pillar, the balance of waxing and abruptions was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Shelter was crumbling there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"I'm talking a lot about the fact that the Larsen-C bell file is in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the slab is under tension and can be broken, if at a key point a piece abrupts."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"melting of Schelfeits and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and displace ice as much water as it emerges after melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice sheet means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only in a small measure, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfile is the fourth largest shelf of the Antarctic with nearly 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the furthest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C Shelf will again grow or go back in the long term, and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not recede the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, however, in the past decades, however, many ice-snaps of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long pinnacle of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and thus ranks among the areas in which the temperature rises at the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to be a Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU requests from the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs have been linked to the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have left their first working day."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously highly sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were recorded for the places that were to be found this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at the moment, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now want to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future oriented of the application scarcity."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside, showing concrete measures for cross-entrants and involve an education campaign, request CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a regular" "competition of public employers". ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, there is a high number of employees who divorce sick or age conditionally from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"thus, the highest time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he recently ordered a fist-thick surprise in the day of the day, when he publicly questioned personnel costs and astonished the remaining parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be checked which allow a withdrawal from the local employers association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should seek a house tariff," "said peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"this means that the CDU, the employees and officials, is trying to pay better than the tariffs for the public service actually envisages."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently dictated exactly, increases or more money is only when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">"however, the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in which employees deal with the provisions of the new prostitution protection law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff."</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone to NGO-migrants-rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge all accusations currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had watched the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that the occupation of dinghy migrants is on board, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected to sit down over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitor their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" essential changes or handicaps "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti in the meantime said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and the cooperation with the local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the Minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" "Berlin outpost" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region to enjoy four days of Trials and sightseeings."</seg>
<seg id="1599">"for this, three friendly guides were available."</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were again and again longer ascents, for which long trials were rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"once again a lookout point at a lookout point, connected by" flowige "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, a lot of altimeters were announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inverters brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled in the open-air inhalatorium healing brine.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres altitude the group had known the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gear for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in the future, sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than being sweating through the stadium racing at wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high commitments."</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first federal alligators who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 of the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire quite new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"it is certain," "that on this train there are still a lot of associations."</seg>

<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-sportsmen under contract, you could be far more often present in these markets than once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the FIFA-simulation FIFA will be fostered at a competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sport, they have long since established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games, e-sport is part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the performance is certainly getting used to the most."</seg>
<seg id="1632">"Ingo Frobbers, too, has long been confronted with the question."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"e-sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, because he is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that you find in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive abilities require a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the itte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"acrobatics, however, also pose problems:" doping becomes increasingly a topic. "</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform at online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the road internationally, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales in three years will be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">There is little difference against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport" is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "write the Deloitte consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already farther.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the Bundesliga club according to Dutt is now obliged to set up an e-sport department."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced to death by Conrad Roy in June, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is unsatisfied.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have ummed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown regrets."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters attorney said, it was a" terrible circumstance that she regretted. "</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her" age or maturity "or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor could read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day when I do not pray for the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything. I try, in spite of all my pains that we will bear for eternity with us, for his sisters," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was" "prosecuted" "by the realization that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or would be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not to have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew up national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the eyes of his suicide, she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you must do is switch on the generator, and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter looked attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she would benefit from the fall by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case dealt with the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murder on her British roommate in Italy in 2007, before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1805">"the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing of the evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dryness."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the Weekly Rioce meet normally on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest Chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the Reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the paylist of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while throughout the country the bodies heap up, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are under state protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are their editors and their inspirator of Feodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deeply even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice. "two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to treat the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has initiated only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"like most murders killed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Feodocice, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unsatisfied and although the terrain is now even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we trust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rioce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing about Valdez as silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloodiest battlefields in the country since rivalling factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that anyone or several people in Sinaloa will be shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug-kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquillity if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Rioce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalling cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed vein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was that Valdez could not force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Feodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the narcotics problem," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Rioce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up willingly that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioodoce team Miss Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guiabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love of the routine be his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job best, and to stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homeward runways and runways, to deal with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the publisher of the Riodocice Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodocice met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who referred to the Governor himself as trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodocice has spread to three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">"there was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker, Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa."</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the government spending, concentrating on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group which in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the public prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this area, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers would have looked at Valdez's column as the best informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few notes and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder than they have written down in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez went away in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of choosing journalists and bringing them around because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that she is re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a" "society". ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note, allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodocice sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of foundries with band rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the on-board channel, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Siren heulled nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez had a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodocice followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern called me to send them to the streets."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received, that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even find that its scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the dying of armored dinosaurs that was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurus which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved condition has amazement researchers, which describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk as he was on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"the Fossil, discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology."</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that this herbivores, although it is covered with armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably threatened by eating meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed him to get better into his surroundings and to evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armors, through his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the countershading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure through meat-eating dinosaurs, that the evolution favored the deterioration of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signals that this nodose-dinosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous have to have been," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on hints about his life, including his conserved bowel content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodose-dinosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with counterbalanced skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous Age was a time when giant thermal episodes, carnivorous dinosaur, which stood on two feet, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk as he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the padded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips hanging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin crates still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a gain in lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>

<seg id="1975">"according to the police, at 17.00 hrs. between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, intermingled."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there were no data on the exact number of injured persons."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was a matter of light to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of ambulance vehicles was at the place of accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: you sit in the train and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened into his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor comes and wakes an unsanted or kisses the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Tickets Check.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the seamless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devaluate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"at the moment, a test operation runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we wipe it out."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will probably be available in many other long distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" is called the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have bought the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"the" "comfort check-in" "works so: one climbs into the train, calling his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button will appear for the electronic devaluation."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when the driver arrives at PLAY, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so one can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to travel relaxed without a ticket control through our train crew, checks in the DB Navigator itself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, DB Telecommunications Management Board. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who are often rail, know that in addition to delays and missed the ticket inspections are among the greatest eras."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for often, one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents required for devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or ID card or otherwise a document you have to assign.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or laryngeal space and delays in controlling one's own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2021">"just one day after arriving in New York City, the hostess of St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment which she rented and scroll through Facebook on her phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a mail from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She dropped her cell phone to return to tweets via people on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people crying out, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a shield with the inscription:" Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman assured his rifle and screamed:" I will kill you... animals all. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the people's point of view, who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who carried a cauliflower and a fitting crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had" "the black experience and the black state many times before this morning." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different strata of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the luck of giving her an experience in which she personally experiences no guile racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after the 9th of August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell arrived at Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came Ferrell into the mind:" do you want to document, or do you try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt's inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not somebody who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, for so I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrara's experience - to show that in the movement" not around a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "Folayan said - she proved to be the most obvious candidate in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrara's history repeats the role of black gay men in the wider Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, based on the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have marked the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay men in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news security cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racist links between the municipality and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she clings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers are discussing bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery says:" that would be a dream "(Nicole Schausten) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the remaining businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Zimmer:" "we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always gladly again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall resettles in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's the shopping list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of it in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is cheap."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, as the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty stores there is almost no more and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmer's market hall going on during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery actually arrives.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit-gallery already manage to sell all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "this simply won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping centre, which is empty, does not need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more space."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market is damaged, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeably similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst constructs a 35-year prison sentence after she openly publicized diplomatic notifications about WikiLeaks site."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-wife, and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg embraced the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how anyone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but spoke openly about identification as a woman since her puberty was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was oppressive, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the big success of her 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"therein, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stugs and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her imprisoned muse exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" Suppressed Images, "illustrated by Shoili Canungo, who would have foreseen a future in which the president would transform the judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama is actually just a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid divisions which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for their superlarge signature among them (the" i "in their family name) an end of" automatic dispersion, based on sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the involvement of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully be taking is that our genome will not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, The Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she pops up with a free-talk-efon in her hand from the United States Discipline of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your words together, then they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulants, who are like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind her liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were searched as suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants due to murders due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the District Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died, 26, after several engravings."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives investigating the engravings as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007 Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been abandoned and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesperson at the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help US investigative authorities in any conceivable manner.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he insisted on suspecting the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"" "Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities will help find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Mr Guglielmi said, the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"however, Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2180">"we will finish the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice-Rector Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA-timetable was updated in this respect," "said Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's timetable for compliance with the code which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he has nothing to worry about for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the doping approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has an error."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day, Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, and then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of doping scandal by WADA from conducting doping checks in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the Exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire drawing of the coup attempt."</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan sent by decree further 7395 officials, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they put on their role as guardians of the worldly state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it won't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot accordingly to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would let a steppe-woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the Realbotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personages like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality to suit your personality as much as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to Frigid (means: resisting) Farrah, disturb one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">True Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator on his website but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origin and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men of course will not keep sex robots, and while FRR noted their rising popularity, they remain tentatively on the brink of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaks out of the boundary zones, can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is however a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Servant ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the imposing effect of its presidency has the strength to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalisation" "and trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that his bib will not be aborted one day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is however an even more frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans on the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness once compared to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both in comparison to trump in fact occurred to a very mild criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump is about, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is astonishingly that there is no application for the requirement profile so far."</seg>

<seg id="2542">"according to the regular periods of notice, it is said that there is still enough time to be involved."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US in the USA causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"whereas those affected usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food cannot penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflamed intestinal milieus, if the same system is also beneficial for people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was however separated, which was not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiology of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome lacked and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria looked on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immaturated immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in genes in tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. Cross. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programmes."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, made in Connecticut, was placed next to a boat from Maine, a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on the South Lawn on July 17th, and so long it remained until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 was evacuated this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate destiny.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commandant. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you were closed," answered the Deputy Commandant. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crew frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn around the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as Trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House."</seg>

<seg id="2740">Helicopters also flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidential supporters."</seg>

<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates involve personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a GRAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also include costs for fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, was defending the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>

<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to highlight that."</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are a church, "declared by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of what was happening."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised the fact that in reporting on violence against the Domspatzen (" "double measure" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the encroachment in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful acts "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation "was striking, such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of interpreting the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you like to go to the church and this is a devout coater."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "strikes were a very normal pedagogical means" "to deal with cheeky children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports about abuse of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the commemorative band" "Mein brother der Papst" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take George Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment to Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotion, the punishment for the students was also more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to many other allegations, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in an interview, Ezekiel explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relied on his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence on protective devices at the "" Regensburger Domspatzen "" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students emphasize his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who became palpable when a Domspatz was musically not top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger ever occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can, at best, reproach it, learn from it too late, or have first hints not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger gave a very excellent testimony," "sincerely", "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teacher who supplied the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rabies."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he was not only flanked with chairs and throwing the keys on the floor, but also drew ear-slap on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"in his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced it in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and violent excesses at the preschool, this is certainly Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is a question of whether it's not more of his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him still work eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put some involvement or knowledge in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claiming to have entrusted to the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said a saddened representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "the real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even confide to parents and siblings, then certainly not a leader who would have been conscientiously a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he would have had timely insights and would have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is reckoned to give him... boys insistent or clearer or even more opened than against their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report concludes with the clear result:" "that students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed during the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to talk from each other."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"however, he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought it to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradicting crimes, as unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violent excesses" "at the" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "was to be read."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking out". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed with a huge detachment of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly channeled and painstakingly suffered, all gathered at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those he had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this was, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject" Primary School "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the reproach remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then only around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently devour ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the secondary school gymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points this out," "that the test penalty continues to be practiced in the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as testing punishments were banned in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows still."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the persons concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he always had looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the death penalty of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted, yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are historians talking about the" snare of anachronism, "that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, nor for what was left in the pre-school of resistances and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am glad that it is finally worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must protect George Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"in the 1970s, his means of disciplining and punishment, so earthy ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he was strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger played back in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of test penalty also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells us from his perspective, that the cathedral sparrows played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I didn't mean that he led a rigorous regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once: without this perfectionism without the request of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I learned Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, benevolent, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of which one could not imagine that he could only do something in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with him, as many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his graduation, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which she is still looking up today and which she is downright."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once more clearly: everything that one reproaches to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
