Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always placed in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now unmistak@@ ably clear .
&quot; I &apos;m always placed in drawers or stuck from outside labels , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are more s@@ nu@@ ff to me . &quot;
&quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as she explains in the current cosm@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , front television with a loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for white blood , she brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all @-@ encomp@@ assing mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us from August 25 .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted back home to the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs in a quick gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he allowed himself with his family to carry on the system of the AL@@ RV on a horse he did not even catch up for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe handed over the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
there are no awards for the sympath@@ etic sports@@ man .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring for decades .
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the f@@ enc@@ ers Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping runner Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sporting events had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Award went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger had a distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ one in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
on the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep it small and cau@@ tions about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax@@ ed the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; it will massi@@ vely rever@@ t regulations , and it makes it strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in that must be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost word @-@ like . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical team @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , there could still be party discussions . &quot;
more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up the coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas , to cancel the Paris climate agreement . &quot;
&quot; with its investment programme Clinton , on the other hand , plans to extend and challenge renewable energy with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better then , demand for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to go up , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics de@@ em him so that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to ask the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost daily . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously with big eyes curi@@ ously into the room .
his mother star@@ es on the tabl@@ etop .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs recorded the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men are fle@@ eing because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically , because they thre@@ aten death or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope . &quot;
&quot; women predomin@@ ate for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced labor , honor mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traum@@ ati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , calls for B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ians single @-@ wing@@ ed women are not isolated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower Francon@@ ia and Lower Francon@@ ia there are floors or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or will men and women be accommod@@ ated together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection , can be read at the rush that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assist@@ ants strei@@ ght : demands for new work combat measures
assist@@ ants of the assist@@ ants have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) required the entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers failed to address the concerns about the contract .
assistant physicians and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA in July .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; persist@@ ently &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Management Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requested official new negotiations about all your worries . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board announced today a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour combat activities starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that , this year , assistance doctors wi@@ el@@ ded six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the B@@ MA Assistant Doc@@ tors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight month long war of the words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin pic@@ ks up his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants to achieve this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was imp@@ lic@@ ated , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if never been a bad thing . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin sh@@ aming , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was spur@@ red .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia .
&quot; the transgres@@ sion was even greater , as it was committed by a presum@@ ed friend . &quot;
re@@ building the etr@@ acker will be difficult if not even impossible .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were alleg@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited their own family from illegal oil trading in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he disp@@ uted this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was ap@@ ologi@@ zing from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after last month &apos;s failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights , which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late ais@@ le attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted appro@@ x. fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because of its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian head of state won a bonus for sure that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting at this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel bad and now unite . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they had not even taken the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately interfer@@ ed with a question of their differences , while Putin decided to stress it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey f@@ lowed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads consul@@ ted at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the management board of the Bank , the brand R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be saved . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for retail business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer be continued and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of the Marche , as how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he rode on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pic@@ ks up the che@@ er when he brings victory to Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone which only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma inspir@@ es fans for years for this kind of sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie several weeks ago with Ep@@ som , that he had already gotten 6.000 prizes if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of the winner in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat racing for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and was granted a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulty when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin de@@ hydr@@ ates Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence group .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s discharge from his duties as chairman of the Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was named after his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it reads ( in Russian ) that he later was Chief of Staff and Head of the Head of the Government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state with regard to the draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ant Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was going back on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , at once wanted to lead the Russian environment policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you almost could say - to trust me for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov picked up the post in December 2011 .
&quot; prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by a further , obvious allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act on the 75 fish for sand@@ a@@ els that were spread out of a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle in Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches of long fishes . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ines . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation which requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the entire deck construction are in their place and the last section of the deck now gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is a trend @-@ setting high @-@ rise and low @-@ rise building . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the northern lighthouse located in the expansion , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , about 6,000 tons weighs and has to be pulled upwards in an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; delicate as the toler@@ ances , on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
three men were lucky to be alive after they were thrown from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at kick@@ ed off on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; said the leader of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue @-@ station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ ating motor had an emergency stop , but it dissolved the boat from the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
&quot; today , someone has wo@@ ken about these men . &quot;
seriously injured - man pun@@ ishes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and at the body .
the police arrested the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed subsequently his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
&quot; on the street , they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building favourable apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be put much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 low @-@ priced homes in the coming years ?
&quot; at the next meeting , the SPD will propose a &quot; &quot; Housing Concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban surfaces will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great conflict in the town hall is , however , that Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent , but as 20 % of the apartments as social apartments as possible . &quot;
a new municipal housing program that will cost millions and still have to be financed should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U would like to make as few regulations as possible , as possible . &quot;
the left wants even harder runs for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , such as Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not entirely new : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compens@@ ate for the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will run in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased by the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be re@@ designed to bring back apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
the problem can be solved at one stroke .
&quot; for in the western city , the end of the year is running . &quot;
around 1800 flats you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only , they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social @-@ dwell@@ ings in the western city is increased dramatically , the aim of the so @-@ called mix is removed . &quot;
a concentration of social ine@@ qualities in just a few parts of the city shall no longer exist .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will be no movement in the discussion .
&quot; President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be in the boat . &quot;
this concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; teen@@ ager and child no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , was su@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s emerged from it ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the USA , Australia and New Zealand started slightly in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon , who will be tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which reflect the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which follows 3@@ 5,000 users , recently informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the introduction of the game , the number of people followed suit every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; be active every day , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of getting diagnosed with cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ itz games that always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
it has become a breakthrough .
&quot; even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track down our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ emon success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
throughout the line brilliant .
and now also the Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast climbed to the competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes , under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the fur @-@ beam during the single multi @-@ camp session of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who gains a multi@@ level title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation , the best of her generation , or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world master@@ medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition that wasn &apos;t so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ camp@@ uses of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party of the team coordinator , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , served as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during its long distance to the top , never planned to have the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which includes her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained .
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will hold as long as it desires . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina led light through two rot@@ ations , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
floating beams and dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the ste@@ ak beam again - and put one on it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embr@@ aced her sof@@ tly when she expected her grand@@ ma - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured out on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Captain , who is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor exercise she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ack &apos;s audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the triple murder does not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ators to get a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; overall , there were seven people killed in h@@ is@@ panic homes within four months in nine attacks and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; distributed Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence , which led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was cancelled half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge he@@ els and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ic : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create that . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let myself go on it .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize her under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first reply was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to help with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could not sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle bicycles .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the characters Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we bring it to him , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ ding of the emotional price of a uncertain future .
&quot; I wondered constantly , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect anyone really to tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives reason to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday . it is expected to cover the whole Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Louis@@ iana and the south of the Mississi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks , threatened with large floo@@ ds to extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
&quot; the governor of Louis@@ iana , John B@@ el Edwards , informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Louis@@ iana to Saturday .
the weather service promised that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it continues to rain in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river close to Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Louis@@ iana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream over@@ flow in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams ski@@ pped people from the flood water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose sharp@@ ly overnight . &quot;
he said he had warned him a further son @-@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; we were awake and the water poured and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a rise in the river in the 48 years , where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all han@@ di@@ caps , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved every three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were staying till Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities are hes@@ it@@ ating ev@@ ac@@ uation guidelines . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been considerably weigh@@ ed by the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rains and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and a school case in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ated in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches that were both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua has been closed to almost two dozens of streets due to the floo@@ ding water and provided sand bags for the residents to take away , hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the City Council . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Mississi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ down said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses should have been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; extingu@@ ished by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple gun injuries , including in the lo@@ oming , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in hospital at his transport to hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z told the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reported the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined whether one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ators could be .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seemed to be a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ eded the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly a continual struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; so it seems that there were several armed fighters involved here , who were very active , &quot; said police @-@ p@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia near the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area met .
there was no sei@@ z@@ ure and the police are currently reporting the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another six @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross r@@ ack@@ et in her arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police still looks for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , which is Catholic , round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts has been an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ly g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routine . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but it doesn &apos;t look like sports classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but reality looks like Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily come into private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents responsible for training , teaching , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started exercising . &quot;
&quot; we have to inspire the communities of au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible physical training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gold and thank you , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assi@@ sts who voted for election rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt &apos;s plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; No Man &quot; &quot; land and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work , to improve the care for ast@@ o@@ unding times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current disability crisis and will be given to meet all doctors . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes caused by talks with the government on the rel@@ uc@@ tance to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt took over the last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now to raise the penetration and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants .
&quot; if he does not do so , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out additional work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dead@@ lines , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting doctors to cover the strike . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better weekly remun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS Staff , urged the assist@@ ants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labour measures achieve nothing but little , but already poll@@ ute teams and service providers and prepare the patient , ple@@ dges and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we spoke to the committee of the Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training lessons , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day drug , which can reduce heart attack risk &quot;
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
Tic@@ ag@@ ack@@ or is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able .
&quot; the launch of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ ack@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said : &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ ack@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ ack@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
the Culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today revealed .
&quot; the former member of the cabinet of cabinet Sir Eric Pic@@ kles impl@@ ements the police , poll@@ s and town houses to ignore the need for election abuse because of &quot; &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now an antagon@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut @-@ off tapes outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should take a demonstration with them , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er must merely call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person , when giving their votes in order to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to church documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government against the wider corruption and financial crisis that ac@@ companies it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special selection court decided that the current mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had deno@@ unced the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man shall have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person chooses another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent election - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leaders of ways to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit the mail@@ box to stop &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social @-@ bet@@ ting purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card .
&quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person once she has released her voice , to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are not eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter .
prohi@@ bit@@ ing political activ@@ ist to edit full let@@ ter@@ ies and envel@@ opes from local elections .
police have the authority to set off shut@@ downs for elec@@ tive stations .
a change of legislation that facilitates an accus@@ ation due to inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
photography ban in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English must be used in electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees are usually en@@ forcing voters to go alone in the bal@@ lot box .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; ast@@ o@@ unding &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no penalty .
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty as a result of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; of the Town Council &apos;s constitu@@ encies . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country we@@ ars a proud heritage as the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spreading of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympi@@ as port@@ ls in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot on top of the edge and band who turned out to be an impressive double @-@ decker in the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is by far not the only one to have gold fighting Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you can give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ians who have more than a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in a very similar way . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he has already heard about his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I probably f@@ aint this as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is to be able to pass through as a double @-@ cat@@ cher for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
&quot; a course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot;
&quot; another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe eye brow@@ s and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alist Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun t@@ anned skin and blonde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
&quot; put theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope &apos;s solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. Football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the gymn@@ asi@@ um Gab@@ by Douglas , which is similar to that by Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises to his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer dies like a pig

&quot; Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer was &quot; &quot; going down &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was turned off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m breast@@ stroke s@@ aff@@ el he gave his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; color , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connector , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went like a sister , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the s@@ wimming@@ pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to fill the gap with China . &quot;
spectators all over Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane Twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Flo@@ at from China &quot; like a pig has died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on stream .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m Fre@@ est@@ amps for women : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connector , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard with which many were talking to him
Twitter users did not look back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment of a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the question about Twitter
the commentary box Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the Flo@@ wer@@ in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympic programme , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the Flo@@ wer@@ in , and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman who tried under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ ter to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back to the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she came back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the position , pulled out her own trousers and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ red when she pulled out the trousers which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other sau@@ c@@ ers before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t want anything to fall asleep again , and went out . &quot;
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with home that had an other person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I have gotten involved , the staff tried to pull clothing out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled it out and did not wash them .
&quot; Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , August 9th in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been taken out of the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if one approaches you from behind , then you should turn off first so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit it with the knee in the bar and twist , while the att@@ acker collap@@ ses before pain , the weapon becomes out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ackers who approach the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and strike the att@@ acker on your chest , then spin the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and put the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to sur@@ pass your money , unless you are a mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue on the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and stran@@ gen@@ ess of a serious test by hiding some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the pres@@ enter and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k fired his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train , as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before checking each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ ho@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to check the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a ten@@ si@@ le toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he ta@@ sted , more than a poor after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to train stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task posed his immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test @-@ line showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric quantity of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to check after their L@@ umin@@ ometer was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ he@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial capacity at different places such as the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this is close to the worst thing I have ger@@ o@@ ed in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; I will do nothing here , because it is disgu@@ sting here inside . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ he@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New Categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended us saying &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;

I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the director of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I need him to lick , just like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to blame , and others in which this was rather difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .

&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys before del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were fl@@ acci@@ d holes on , wooden pl@@ anks were flung wide , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated on the walls . &quot;
the family was res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not so beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , attacked street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ eton , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will possibly be dem@@ ol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; they were found in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden pra@@ w@@ ns &quot;
neighbours promised that they saw them fighting on the street and needed to call the police on a regular basis
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are unbelievable .
&quot; this morning , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have missed the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was established at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the church building , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , since del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours , and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the floor
house@@ keeping workers now have to w@@ edge up gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after having found guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ eton , who came to life in 2013 when a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police say they will del@@ og@@ ging les@@ see who don &apos;t cling to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can accept themselves without repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists to panic in Portugal after a conscientious military jet flies over the beach
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of aerial forces made an unbelievable dive trip
&quot; the air strikes indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was &quot;
&quot; this was the moment when the frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic , after a ti@@ res@@ sy jet set@@ back over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video footage showed how the military airplane flew close to the sun an@@ bet@@ ters on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ists sprang up when they began understand@@ ably to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me .
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied in panic when the airplane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility of the area , the jet was somewhat lower than usual due to the bad visibility in the vicinity , but the air@@ strikes persist@@ ently ins@@ ist that security was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; this summer , area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , in which four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which restri@@ cts its vision . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting the first step towards the first title win in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the bac@@ kl@@ ash increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Double@@ gew@@ ater has to disp@@ ense with the defeated cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is also missing . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a change of change in the training in the training , with which the query was clari@@ fied at least initially in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing for the status as number one . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique reno@@ unced a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but for that T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other competitions . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince . &quot;
Sev@@ ille in turn has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; with eleven successes , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
MA Long in his own league table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending def@@ enders &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the world rank@@ ings first hit the &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als tournament and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea was the last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sentences and time @-@ outs , they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
they had gone back to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ enders in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches until now I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had concluded . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts were posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , MA had to fight only in the first movement . &quot;
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang on only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma was not the expected stir@@ ring match .
&quot; however , nevertheless enough breath @-@ taking ball changes were to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the bronze match against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had with@@ drawn a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states losing their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within the own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , false reports on his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ ook . &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
Utah is usually a secure bank for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were driven by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , also Arizona and Georgia are also applicable . &quot;
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump respon@@ ds to the question of how he wants to stop the Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he does not do anything other than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of doing so , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would take more under arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : three sc@@ ams at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer to the home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee informed them to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary revealed that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village , gave a urine test under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team leader Ken@@ ia by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
&quot; IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to en@@ force its own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person informed . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an evaluation , &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and spent as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed over and signed the sample , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan &apos;s boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in charge of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes , who was on the list for training control of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in the Peking World Championship in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he should have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against fin@@ s of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he should have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation during IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing trials .
&quot; during the announcement of more than 2,000 dop@@ ing control checks laid out by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; before the summer Olympics in Brazil , the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya started from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runners @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the Beijing World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches have been raised again and again that in Kenya dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sport fraud . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had addressed them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type was surface @-@ covering and systematically dor@@ man@@ t . &quot;
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth dream .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ stein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays a elder Maria . &quot;
she reminds us of her love with Tony while younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because she is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the West Side Story : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the pu@@ ro@@ wers went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls , who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ ye@@ e , said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and after her family died shortly after she had prepared to leave the country of war , and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ ye@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from eastern London rode to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was informed that she married a IS@@ IS fighters in Syria , and within a few months became a wi@@ dow . &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , nomin@@ ates Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the dec@@ eased judge on the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he would expect Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have spoken with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said that Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;

&quot; the Tre@@ ats magazine is working with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere , to bring Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the view that it does the calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally with open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass ex@@ odus
&quot; whoever does not suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ approaching Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kur@@ dish community of Germany anticip@@ ates a short term , with tens of thousands of prot@@ ectors from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the former president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the harsh preced@@ ent of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand guards from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already covered Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions over months , there are 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
&quot; after put@@ ted put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks are added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which itself takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; with that , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the tear @-@ off on the remaining cur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the President demanded that the Federal Government positions itself &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics . &quot;
I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ practitioner destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way , the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper , on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks continued the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this figure was 11.@@ 386 people , and there@@ with almost 29 percent of all eligible for asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; this survey does not cover the war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; 2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and ground combat - this bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end voices , just lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people over itself . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say this at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
what is exciting is how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
&quot; S@@ ella , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it already did his legendary word@@ less predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel holds the guilt on the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which probably will cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale conferences ; Merkel Par@@ liam@@ entary elections lie in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it is too bad for anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely elimin@@ ates the usual electoral distances on market places and before shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this is what Kok@@ ert says , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also , the Union noted that in the country you would leave the base that she needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , you hardly exist in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner co@@ king on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD a particularly dedicated campaign . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won with 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , will make the leap into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holidays @-@ need and impose their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it calls the pres@@ idents Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tors go on track search for native stimul@@ ants under the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , just cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; an election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment : Gast@@ stätten suffer from locking
&quot; there is nothing to complain about the r@@ api@@ dity , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for building work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end only at 20.00 , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south as scheduled at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the object is also v@@ owed to include those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to furnis@@ hing houses . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the block of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
the ev@@ asion by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; says the chief conductor Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many roads were looking for and more familiar with their nav@@ i than sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were displaced in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed lim@@ iters were not comp@@ lied with , the assembly demanded ampli@@ fying the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have been fl@@ ashed .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become more cal@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales bur@@ gl@@ ary with them , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every Euro sales .
&quot; in addition , the sales revenue is &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road organization &quot; &quot; stopped its operation &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it must also bear the dis@@ advantages that arise through the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous is handled .
&quot; in all the suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; however , that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently passing by due to complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot go here , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; having returned to the end of restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;
it is constantly being screw@@ ed to laws in the name of counter @-@ terrorism .
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lays down a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a cancellation status with terror to do ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ see anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in this . &quot;
&quot; as the interior minister , however , he was lying on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will leave a little time before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more ast@@ o@@ unding .
&quot; some are already known , announced , deno@@ unced : that a new security authority is to take care of the cris@@ p of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second start for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; he still holds this for reasonable and demanding nothing , which does not have a chance at the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; they have , in part , in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people before deport@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; refugees , who are targeted in the country , are to check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; in case of accus@@ ations for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some are still un@@ exp@@ elled and leave questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and at some points - in the im@@ balance of patient , for example , the question arises : what has this to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , given the high number of refugees , many people worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that people were deeply involved , could not be cl@@ inging even in election times . &quot;
the inner security has moved enorm@@ ously into the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are competitions . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties there went a high level . &quot;
&quot; only a secret dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , where the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the dual citizenship . &quot;
the Mai@@ zi@@ ère also struggles around irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
he doesn &apos;t think of a revers@@ al of the double @-@ pass .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ charge it is not sensible .
&quot; and in a bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package at all corners is constitutional and if it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could cause contro@@ versy .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Sig@@ mar Gabriel partner@@ ed with cau@@ ti@@ ously willingness to talk and say , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still navig@@ ating g@@ lim@@ pf@@ lich .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the ex@@ tradition figures rise worldwide . &quot;
but it is not in all markets running around .
&quot; with the recall action , there is a ver@@ teb@@ ra around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen for@@ fei@@ ts in the second half of the year with the deliveries .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some good running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturers can show a plus in spite of its many brands and some good running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus again stra@@ ined the total sales , as the company reported in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Germany &apos;s home market , shipments dropped by almost one @-@ sixth . &quot;
&quot; Mr Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s brand sales agency , first of all , reduced the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; have also given rise to purchase restra@@ int . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was also bur@@ dened by the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas sc@@ ars first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus in be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
chief Executive Vice President Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales representative from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles sold Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated passenger tests with a software .
in Germany alone VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
&quot; in the course of the conversion , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the transformation of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance have no deteri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the autom@@ aker is issuing a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen made its German customers a guarantee of re@@ engineered diesel models . &quot;
&quot; this would have confirmed VW representatives in the German Federal Ministry of Transport , last Monday . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and KBA fully . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion , there are no deterior@@ ations and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen is using the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not what it meant in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , to ensure uncertainty regarding possible warranty rules as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see will require criminal interest from rich savings in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Mr Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see in it a signal : ordinary spar@@ es should not fear , to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; if banks store money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposits or cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time he kept 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not evaluate . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent &quot; costs , &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ principle , the cost is now further . &quot;
&quot; easy to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ co @-@ union of Bavaria stated , &quot; The ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry them alone , &quot; &quot; business @-@ economic dur@@ ably not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their bank charges , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian Volk@@ s- and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay surface @-@ covering compensation for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , on the Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is more luxuri@@ ously equipped by the property . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it hats for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are known to the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria , who charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Dest@@ ination records : who bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men of middle aged love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section , to see him under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ en@@ ic men &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ discussed revival of vinyl records is not attribut@@ able to a boom in M@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able group of buyers . &quot;
it is also no hor@@ den by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer their emotions rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit before I stand up , hold my hands and somewhat determine how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart Soh@@ o slowly loses its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill in the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( Number of numbers : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( numbers : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and ready . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend some time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my key .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers , which he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , who have heard about the com@@ eback and see how to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection since 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that plate shops offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some of the record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to move back to the stability of trusted records of vinyl , of objects that che@@ er happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get busy mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee in@@ still@@ s from a stack of records . &quot;
&quot; a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people , who bought a record last month , have not yet listened to . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % possess a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
at this time of news report I would probably look very worried while I pu@@ zz@@ led by a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Keys : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; trophy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said : &quot; I do not own record players , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead vinyl record so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more product @-@ sensitive , less musi@@ cl@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come first slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has dedicated the record nearly a whole floor , has an entertaining audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle aged women . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ps out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but n@@ ailing psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a sh@@ ov@@ el @-@ pe@@ w@@ ter than a big purchase .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting sheets is no real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record @-@ lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I feel the appearance of patterns of jeans , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group themselves for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my investigations yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record holders that exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not by che@@ ating through disks of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they steer clear of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who over@@ looks nothing clu@@ eless man of middle age . &quot;

French court decl@@ ines offer over demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to offer 72 temporary shops selling cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ y@@ drink , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with the fact that shops and restaurants are important , as free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups , would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led to the fact that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the deport@@ ation of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas could offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the tear , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is administr@@ atively operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two Relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants , on Friday , estimated that the number of survivors in the jungle increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains comb@@ at@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performances in the Olympic Tem@@ se , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to get it . &quot;
&quot; I keep on watching the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; hon@@ estly , it &apos;s hard for me to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he needed to analyse in peace , which reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time @-@ driving World Cup in October in Qatar .
I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times .
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time Zeit@@ let World Champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in different states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are tested , which are to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ looking En@@ forcement Tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used on accidents , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to bridge bridges with temporary temporary police , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary shar@@ pen@@ er for compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a long @-@ lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be detected at the same time across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as traffic messages for time , road and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply ch@@ ew@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ resistant outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to indications by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ inch rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er rug@@ by hit the final hur@@ dle on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the shape of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji created a master class in the handling , side @-@ st@@ eppe , draw@@ back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic Gold Med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to it in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost almost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began to mar@@ vel at the attacks of the attacks of GB@@ s .
&quot; it felt for the Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au landed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he walked around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely caught the ball .
&quot; a stock@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ aza Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua takes a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to the interval .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB conducted fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was going through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ ate , whose fans sang , sw@@ elled and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whist@@ le rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and GB kick@@ ed out in the lawn . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a short semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant later tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing victory
there will be no lighter gold than in those games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first stop to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio de Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she drove to the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 39.@@ ter inf@@ lic@@ ted effort , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets that slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al to go@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and no one was more active than the trainer who was not aware 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was fortunate that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right concept under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing on itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even larger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have desired a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t lose a race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be torn .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something mad@@ ness .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I &apos;m an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is retired . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavaria far exemplary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Francon@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was said some time ago in the original on in an article by the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Francon@@ ia wor@@ ded the co@@ er@@ ci@@ on association .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ t@@ stein@@ gruppe served &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the ken@@ nel association , stands 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ t@@ stein@@ Group , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic metres of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; for further towns and villages , there are water supply contracts . &quot;
&quot; the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water @-@ line construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sets at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the ponds of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no dead@@ lock , and I have repeatedly added novel@@ ties because water supplies pot@@ able water and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers trust@@ ing , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has been involved with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has just@@ ly lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ t@@ stein@@ gruppe in front of the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a faithful fl@@ ap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a cli@@ max@@ i from his point of view , he described the well @-@ gro@@ unded fountain construction and restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult employment were the pipe @-@ breaking at the high tank at Kirch@@ ner on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained once , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water @-@ gathering association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who joins Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko works openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots on a partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and killed her in a deadly injury .
&quot; the man has called upon us and stated to have shot his companion , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him , he will be publicly punished . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could be traveling by car .
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man carries a bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon in himself , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ fe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was on the scene . &quot;
steel - View for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened by green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; the Federal Minister of Economy , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , remains the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Con@@ version in the German steel industry . &quot;
I am really happy that after two years we finally managed to achieve tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases coming from the blast furnace for power generation for its own consumption , to ask for the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z ; there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ confidence .
thus the status quo of the present scheme is largely as@@ cri@@ bed .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to grow when the world &apos;s largest producer of producing China cast mass @-@ carbon steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers launch price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , impor@@ ting import duties on import @-@ steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have been suspended . &quot;
uncle@@ ar is how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclude closures of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tons , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl concluded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the crowd went back for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing stir@@ s me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; for singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular cooperation , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures are often solved in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to talk and organise to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand their lungs are not as fast as the pu@@ ste in everyday life .
&quot; even though it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority ; it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of her youth . &quot;
&quot; with lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia are rel@@ ying on long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head is also asked for special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
to concentrate at the same time on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; especially elderly people who live alone , do not just focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I have a long time for something , I become better and grow above me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears you when a sound goes wrong with it ? &quot;
&quot; on the search for the appropriate offer , senior citizens have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior ench@@ or , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , tells H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats react more sensitive as han@@ go@@ vers on the cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect the rep@@ ay@@ ment of cat babies on adult animals has .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ thing did not leave the males cold - however , they always kept the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens at the sight of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster on k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who in great need choose , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the team of researchers had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens was different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
nine adult males and eight females were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were pre @-@ played for a pack of babies who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more powerful k@@ itt@@ ens , who were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their findings in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted differentiated on the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this cry was played by the very sof@@ ter k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability may be con@@ genital or developed with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , no matter if they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey has once again played an important soccer game . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not possible to stop football before football .
&quot; against the former strong k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the prosec@@ utor made an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the addi@@ ct living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ ley@@ r is to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; it is true that , initially for 90 days , the state of exception is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan to be termin@@ ated on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the bulk of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch@@ isms . &quot;
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at the winner of the &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; winner , Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will be able to get there again . &quot;
&quot; with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 winner .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master was a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; after the rounds of rounds at the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will also say good @-@ bye to the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South per Li@@ g , it was only ranked 6th . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal matches as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sten @-@ King . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; at the time of the AC Florenz , the agreement reached by AC Florence and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas was announced only after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the storm would have to be ready to reno@@ unce around one @-@ third of its estimated annual growth of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly noted : &quot; his salary at Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals of medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already banned twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines of the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed her start right in front of the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was kick@@ ed out of mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
it was a rus@@ hing scene : with a super@@ imposed smile she was stum@@ bled into the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; as a fortress , that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a bul@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed two times due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his ban , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champ@@ ions run even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champ@@ ionships had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after having been detected using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , and she defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champ@@ ions , world champ@@ ionships of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 have been positively tested on the prohibited Stim@@ ul@@ ant @-@ Medium of Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the occasional intake and was blocked six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , entered into Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete was able to detect so many medals retro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after finding testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the Bronze Med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games also recognized , due to a decision by the International Sport@@ judi@@ ci@@ ary CAS . &quot;
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , it is ranked two of the world ranking . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the World Record and Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin has been tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , critics have found evidence of taking a banned nutritional supplement , the locking of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA decreased mild and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered ker@@ fs and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it . &quot;
she planned her journey home for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , Austrian citizens are also still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in an excav@@ ation quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; then again two explo@@ sives went up early , and another man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police indication . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air before the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army @-@ iron Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee to journalists early in the morning . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves on possible motives , but it is probably the act of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insurrection , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still uncle@@ ar what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police instruc@@ ted their officials throughout the country to enhance safety around important governmental buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its homepage to follow the instructions from Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environs . &quot;
&quot; after the conflict between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday caused a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military big influence even in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to steal chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ affir@@ med itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , in Bangkok , there were 20 people killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is recommended by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists have also set the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; identifying movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the free @-@ liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said constitutional Princip@@ al Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß from the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by means of alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identified &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ aß said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the Islam@@ ists are just like right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda is intended to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; most recently , there have been reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; identified &quot; African politicians . &quot;
Ma@@ aß said that he did not know .
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party , in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal comment@@ aries and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ths said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be legal @-@ term structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that further legal groups or small groups form attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the existing groups were established on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Mao expressed concern that many sur@@ geri@@ es went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the crimes suspected of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings did not have been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes , which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised itself by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olymp@@ ians or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that it could temporarily no longer be seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th position of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was not just a sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received special start@@ rights by the International Swimming Association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; as in ae@@ dic@@ s most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap fast .
some media called it &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only beat a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and never had such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then dri@@ fts into the holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNB@@ C . &quot;

&quot; in investor @-@ circles , it was on Friday that the shareholders were finally the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; but after 5 years , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the last poor Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable previous year &apos;s quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million shr@@ ank by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter , in particular , the company &apos;s lower value has been stra@@ ined in the face of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the company &apos;s amor@@ tis@@ ation of 139 million euros , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8,@@ 2 million euros . &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into craw@@ ls in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a travel association with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , shared the police with them . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , had to diver@@ t their data to an accommod@@ ating truck , which was partly on the counter @-@ car . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ person on the Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund police .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a trol@@ ley came to the accident place on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ riv@@ alled travellers were brought back by a bus back to the P@@ ew@@ sum Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ ner district .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of wast@@ ewater amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of 1 October 2016 for the area of the new water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ding@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of so far 2.10 euro ; for Al@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will be increased at the latest , if appropriate correc@@ tive measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a high level of calculation , the wast@@ ewater fee in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , Kul@@ mb@@ ach District Office was established in the hom@@ etown of Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ cover these wast@@ ewater treatment systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal basis , the market of Kas@@ endorf is required to cover the systems cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
charges are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Director of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt thus founded the engraving systems that are relatively small in all three wast@@ ewater treatment plants , with a very low waste water treatment , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water supply in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to the age of renovation and repair costs , the previous calculation period for all three plants had a considerable scope . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the area of Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after nearly 20 years operation the first sewage treatment had to be extended , the sewage sl@@ ud@@ ge has to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses were the continued care and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were completely sm@@ ashed .
&quot; Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs at the wast@@ ewater facilities in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater con@@ federation should not be extended because it is a matter of defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria regi@@ sters for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot;
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods has been observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; prices fell by clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Eff@@ ect as Asian cartoon critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are unique , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all false entries come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have raised criticism in the past where they were accused of making Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users that gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated contro@@ versy had indicated a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
&quot; the news and the indign@@ ation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat saw that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was conceived as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et about the photos has been widely used , that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable and blind &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very disgu@@ sting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ backed , but that the yellow face was drawn into the out@@ going extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dragon .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are different from race di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the introduction practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat dism@@ issed the cultural background of his associates , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently set up a personnel manager who focused on subordin@@ ate population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; on their part , Z@@ hu said she is being closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; military leadership frau@@ dul@@ ent IS@@ IS intelligence services , re@@ jects Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command changed post @-@ intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Ar@@ med Forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence @-@ related information , typically sent down by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com agencies , regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism , as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts have exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Releases , opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts , the report noted . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com han@@ di@@ cap publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the points of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com are underway due to the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence agencies on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaging the mor@@ als among analysts &quot; and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention at the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; determined political opinion . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , which were recorded after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ torate were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also assumed that &quot; experts at times have diver@@ gent opinions in interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest reviews of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of the divisions of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker confirms that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , the team had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this knowledge , however , was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK before &quot;
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will achieve the first and second place within their group from six teams . &quot;
&quot; the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the Dutch , who will lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as usual , the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans released a surprising f@@ uss because of their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time she had a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in her hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better place . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work@@ space in London , which we now have . &quot;
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ d@@ der .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake ring in the first half of the game with a bac@@ kl@@ ash from the se@@ am area . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she executed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and flaw@@ ed the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling consistent and inevitable , a rag@@ ing relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the wrist protection to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympics and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names being sent to Prime Time , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tr@@ amp . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally recognized : gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the Bre@@ ast swimming and may have a long reign .
&quot; but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ ingly perceived that many that I had inter@@ viewed did not know that it is an olymp@@ ic sport at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it never won a medal in jumping on the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an ath@@ lete from 2012 until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ ns school as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a Earth @-@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gymn@@ asi@@ um and the diving , the two sports that essentially uni@@ fies it . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El re@@ bo@@ under which means &quot; trampoline . &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , you will be judged according to the execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straightforward .
&quot; medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also in television broad@@ casts a further under@@ mining goal : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented effort is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a viewer to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I find myself to be a bit ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she jumps down , seemingly he@@ avier like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , but the dre@@ amy , elegant liqui@@ dation of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming by 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 onwards .
&quot; in the middle of Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ un@@ ement and the obj@@ ecti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner suggested a short time ago , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ se , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , met with the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot;
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at gun@@ fights .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more areas .
&quot; last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Commission is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even harder , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the head of the Horn of Africa by the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression by the government , the opposition in the country has been limited , where dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ vi@@ m Tes@@ la , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control over 100 per cent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts , such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years were more or less forced to use tur@@ mo@@ il and could be re@@ armed . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of wor@@ ding under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as who come from Ethiopia mainly prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this too changes .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a Oro@@ mos leader . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ ambig@@ uous reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia experienced such tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections which , according to the statistics of analysts , ple@@ dged to be ple@@ dged by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in recent months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ utation of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , controlled by Tig@@ ray , attacked and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even though it has recently concluded that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin tigh@@ tro@@ pe walk . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS , &quot; &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State &apos;s terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , asser@@ ting statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump hur@@ ried back to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on suggest@@ ing that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the alleg@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism le@@ aks down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he thought the Russians were to ch@@ op Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump accepted an et@@ ched tone , as his read@@ ings went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leadership with a big advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally temp@@ ted to not excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while rein@@ forcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s sc@@ iss@@ ors have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ seats , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton acted as the Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by taking control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of le@@ aning on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him . &quot;
&quot; he scor@@ ned the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ology than just a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once over the price of the market , café is in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; verb Cafe was a pe@@ eled cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee was served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which de@@ posed Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
domestic wor@@ sen@@ ed it as a last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and manager of the new café . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , enter@@ tained a lot . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu you can find sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions . &quot;
there are natural zip@@ pers .
&quot; the café does not serve any beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez told that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that I was lying on the coffee and the culture in the verb which I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same S@@ ame .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment , and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not hold a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to produce a special soap for basket with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez told that he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours are welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favourites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was devast@@ ated to the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt always said that the entering of the restaurant and the ordering of a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water@@ shed soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on this day was a little modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a home at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; the latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop , a small , be@@ ati@@ ful I@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixes . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter asked Hack@@ ensch@@ midt , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans , who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the ways in which the country would end up being no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as ten@@ se was the new budget diet : mysterious food such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ ver , &quot; &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , since qui@@ che could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange bl@@ ends have been tried out , since a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy common sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the family business recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the food habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing prescri@@ ptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ wives &quot; &quot; and the challenge to turn p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government response to hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ milli@@ oned man from the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ fic reality .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate a temple with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with eating was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the tor@@ rent incident .
&quot; after the plates arrived at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it will be called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; no sour cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few min@@ ced wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killing Bom@@ b Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bom@@ bed attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers set their own lives to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the conserv@@ ation@@ ist who shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a mam@@ mal from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; he has never seen himself as heroes , he said , &quot; &quot; For me this is Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs above the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest whir@@ l@@ wind is almost 400 years old
clan : &#91; LL@@ J@@ K &#93; Post@@ ings : 1927
Greenland shar@@ ks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ ks have only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ f@@ tly flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long argued that Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter at the surface . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ ks , researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little . &quot;
&quot; her slow motion pus@@ hes her , when she broad@@ cast@@ ed six animals with a transmitter before S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; prey make this shar@@ k nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and seek car@@ c@@ asses that are tor@@ tured from higher water layers down .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues were now studying 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , which catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of eye lens is already created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens @-@ core .
&quot; therefore , their birth should lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , as atomic weapons seeking larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ l , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lenses , which result from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to arrange the length of an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this should also be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ ane problems live above all in icy waters , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; also the present record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
&quot; so , later they mature - and they age slower . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of the mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building plot in double pack
&quot; with topics relating to building , the municipal council has focused on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board adopted the notification of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently identified residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the mot@@ ions could be placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of land in residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeals to young families and elderly elderly alike .
&quot; as it was said , construction sites can now immediately report in the city hall , about the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to consult the municipal council in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also en@@ force inquiries to settle further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created surface area in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area , which is already designated there , is extended by two plots towards the 21@@ 12 state road . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; thus , the city of the Main has the best opportunities to move from London to jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether bank buildings continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far been given admission to the UK . &quot;
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lobby group comp@@ utes with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it is also worse than Dublin in infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city has an easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of corporate consultancy Merc@@ er , the city stands in place 7 , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in London , according to figures from Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US arbitr@@ ator decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs incurred from the hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated by a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents pending in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge disclosed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ l &apos;s and other un@@ ethical conduct . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the complaint on Thursday , US president Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to balance the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained about each other and took property on laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir belongs to the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
forces supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; backed by the U.S. forces , the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j is rec@@ ap@@ tured near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left it , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are tr@@ unc@@ ing the remaining group of fighters , which have buried themselves within the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the D@@ KS connected military council Reuters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting auction work , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and numbers 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton has published its fiscal statement for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton earned an income of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his fiscal declarations of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; led Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false phrases and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as the reason for his refusal to have a control check by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clinton wrote election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the release of the presidential candidate of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday , asking Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax declaration . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she addressed the topic during a speech to the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done in the last decades , and to publish its tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that in the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes , and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a topic . &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ets whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industry con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns . &quot;
&quot; he said he was also subjected to an IR@@ S control , and Tr@@ ump was afraid of the voters and not against tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published fiscal statement back to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clinton , who now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s tax statement from 2015 showed that they were only related to USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ fonds from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and revenue of USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with cha@@ anges , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
environ@@ ment@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ man@@ ia .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crop , without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many spe@@ aders have used to defend themselves . &quot;
&quot; Friday is the &quot; &quot; Wel@@ fare Day &quot; &quot; dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants off their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; commented the CEO of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi wolf &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; ch@@ ili@@ man@@ ing mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is shot to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom will burst with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust in the air . &quot;
a hint quite usually already enough to hunt the elephant .
&quot; a last chance is a ver@@ fer who sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot;

Jewish Director breaks the Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media record after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israeli pres@@ election , as it claimed Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
he wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ si Bristol has a chance to choose Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and was upset .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not need explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some pres@@ elected the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; it was said in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all charges and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , the mirror reports . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; Israel did not engage in the Quick Selec@@ tive List , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
add that the country code has now been added .
police employ tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they gathered to fight against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties started when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
&quot; according to the Govern@@ ors of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti spray against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters in the masses went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ se President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which had been dism@@ issed from office by a vote of the Senate on their dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies on business in the country grew strongly , shared the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was reached by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian Foreign Ministry announced approximately 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily to travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran achieved the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; it could be said that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for a witness : exceeded the beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y accident happened on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; taking a gun @-@ weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces were asked by the staff of the beverage market the issuing of cash and then fled at first by foot and then probably with a silver colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share with them . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 m tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly visible .
&quot; after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel parking place opposite the car park entrance to the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; those who have made observations at the time of crime ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : games and fun at summer Fri@@ days
&quot; eight beautiful and cheerful days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old with their super@@ vis@@ ors during their summer Fri@@ days in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
in the cal@@ m@@ ly located Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the zoo .
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the group at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invites you to jump , swim and splash in the hot days . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers with their self @-@ prepared bodies such as Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; workshops have been created , be@@ ati@@ ful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the spare time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned happy .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the move on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next post @-@ pilgrimage of all ministers in a period of two years , the upper @-@ level round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and we finally decided to visit the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y with the open gate of mercy on Freiburg cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern were on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed pilgri@@ m@@ ages and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; Hor@@ b drove by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where a cathedral of Our Lady stands also and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was taken from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches continued to sing together a song from specially composed pilgrims &apos; song . &quot;
the parish families of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal for the overnight stays .
&quot; thanks to Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we passed via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that the stage came to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first we had to descend to about 500 metres in altitude and afterwards climbed again . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the beach in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the min@@ is met at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the min@@ is arrived on the pilgrimage destination by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home , when Br@@ ite Gold is bo@@ unded for cycling &quot;
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner sha@@ ved last night in the male team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor part , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he came home to win a victory from the Favorites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago while Ho@@ y got the fifth of six Olympic gold medals .
&quot; they repeated the trick after they held in March at the London World Championships in London , despite the Ho@@ ys retreat only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a sign up .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the gravel that has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Kenn@@ y - who won Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner four years ago won a Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualification rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; one lap after his lap , Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner stopped . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that followed in a higher gear to slow it down , and to enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ dem , when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the Triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , there was a hint that after a weak start he obviously dropped off on the track . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win on your own .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
&quot; they came to the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had cont@@ ested with the qualification before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on his strong team of train to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a string of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
&quot; in the background , drama played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ tices as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land question@@ able due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operators termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ish all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a sub @-@ convention for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , since the sm@@ el@@ ting consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; the company shared . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts should be so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; hence , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already registered in its annual closing in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the melt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement guilty of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tom@@ ago some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner clan &apos;s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to we@@ eping , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; revealing the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , sung reality video , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z on@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é story of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate somehow in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is rather similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the edition pul@@ ls a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the Anti@@ que &apos;s 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the disclosure of his cover star is expected to be expected to se@@ ep pictures of the magazine before the official announcement in the last two years .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Win@@ ner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if none of these applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success does not like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ tes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled up again when the message came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but walking around on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centers indicate a total of 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are reported annually by the municipal law centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already well @-@ equipped , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is expected that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s Municipal Co@@ unc@@ ils , said that the last survey of the National Union of Community Research Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land congreg@@ ational centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who rely on violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and de@@ pressing debts , families that have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dism@@ issed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will shor@@ ten the means by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of need@@ less people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and the Federal Minister of Justice , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government filled its promise to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Campa@@ ign accused of being a weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action , after she was informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina made a fire@@ arm on a staff while in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini had been waiting for months to have waited for the matter internally , before realizing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the train , and r@@ ammed the run at Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after having appe@@ aled to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four more persons had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini admitted . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can candidate proclaimed a ri@@ ot when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - gun@@ fighter owners and weapons @-@ friends - should take action if his ri@@ val was chosen by H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign was clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inf@@ use violence .
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence , and of Philip because of bodily injury and lasting mental harm . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps Press officer Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for an opinion .
experiments to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls at its consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey in front of country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished . &quot;
this gave representative surveys by the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to rain , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ uc@@ tant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the Parliament &apos;s Parliament .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would be missing in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came into the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite pal@@ p@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would today range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for some Euro fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it Computer Fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ er@@ bottle format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit very slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked out similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price is quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus approx . 1400 euro . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would start the start of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has been different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile spar@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today providers dominate the market that came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; ever and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smart phone users around the world . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple , of which 5@@ 55 million units were sold . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app @-@ providers and the telecommunications companies arrive . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the beginning of 2007 . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : one music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen is easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the triumph@@ al proc@@ ession of Apple began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night . &quot;
&quot; they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ a now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks on his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get rid of the smartphone once , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens management board for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will be able to create 10,000 new appren@@ tices , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in natural growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the 2012 London Olympics were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad block@@ age &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software vendors attempts to b@@ ypass the ad block@@ age , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block mark@@ ers on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it said that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the enco@@ ding with respect to its advertising display to make it adver@@ tise the recognition of which part of the site advertising is to be difficult to detect . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the time @-@ bound Open Source Community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of scor@@ ners &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest corporate social media company has embar@@ ked on the fight , is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying displays for the industry have become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook using their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue footprint . &quot;
&quot; the company has put it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on the mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ person shared . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a huge amount of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile seeing such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt method , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman accused of susp@@ ecting suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning , when suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 years , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill herself . &quot;
she still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which was a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , told G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a coll@@ ision prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers would not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman of the neg@@ ligent killing was acqu@@ itted after having crossed a man and killed a man on the A1 , near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the road , he took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once inv@@ oked conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benefited from a Sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus intensi@@ fies its day @-@ length of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun war@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees col@@ der than those of the earth today . &quot;
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions of years --@@ was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as its Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research L@@ etters .
Patrick Roy steps back as coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to take decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league . &quot;
&quot; he brought the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers again call on talks , put strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles for the remun@@ eration of the North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current strike , &quot; it is said in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , start the beginning of next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates to its competitors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s couns@@ elling follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
&quot; the company said that additional cuts in the company are giving the space required , in order to get through the market down@@ turn . &quot;
&quot; Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which works for many and not only a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods with the planet origin stand . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star@@ cores , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star @-@ house , born about 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning to the quick@@ est .
&quot; at peak @-@ rotation rates , these gri@@ pping stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the mag@@ net@@ osphere of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable stell@@ ar spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars run slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars s@@ lows down their rot@@ ational rates and hang out their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star steps down
the tears run at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays for the last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; good@@ bye &quot; to both , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ times All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant in Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a coach and a youth coach in the future - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players are showing similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted into the Statue Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field so controversial his appearance is outside the place .
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 prohibited stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years through an anti @-@ aging hospital in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have been given the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win every game , &quot; et@@ ched Y@@ ank@@ ees Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ ri@@ val Boston red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing sample Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - just before the start of the critically considered athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these messages come to the wrong time . &quot;
&quot; last Sunday , in Ch@@ en , the hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de di@@ ure@@ tic was proven to be used as a m@@ ating agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International sports court CAS confirmed their exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the talks about 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio , news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the forbidden substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to him with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why sports@@ men are not pulling the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; case was also known , the London Olympics Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , including the L@@ äu@@ er nation of Kenya in Rio many bad news . &quot;
&quot; in swimming sport , the former tre@@ aties in China also had taken care of violent disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang per@@ ch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focus of an examination of the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently picking up targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims will@@ ingly paid the solutions required by the perpetr@@ ators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ out software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be pres@@ et ran@@ som is considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most mal@@ e@@ ater programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered the black@@ out software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months al@@ ar@@ ingly fast . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or Database files as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als permanently .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies reported revenue losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals had already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute by the loss of ak@@ efulness . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : does not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ code sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; considering the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explained safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by downloading malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail is then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made in an infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals are instruc@@ ting sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known by many companies that better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on the ability to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful edi@@ fication , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened by the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future have completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the h@@ acker conference of Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heater might well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could become a topic in Industry 4.0 too . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty crowded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work narrow at any point . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling down . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l for high @-@ performance and 10@@ 26 l with fli@@ pped back rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded like cinema seats and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to ceilings . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded easily , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do his job somewhat more quietly . &quot;
&quot; the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying . &quot;
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the safety systems belong to the city emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane maintenance assistant . &quot;
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when maneu@@ vering .
the long @-@ beam assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent tem@@ per respon@@ ds to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed if necessary .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI port are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ 0,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday vehicle . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
Air@@ line is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) , however , is conceivable only in the event of dangers that are typical of the air traffic . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee egg in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of living , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , patients with ill will only get money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel . &quot;
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
&quot; in the case of the trial , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of its tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought back the holiday@@ makers to a defective sewage plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family was the opinion that the trip had been flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
&quot; indeed , the sewage plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the promot@@ er only learned about it just before the plain@@ ti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so judgment . &quot;
especially since no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ious one another - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; at Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the atro@@ cities committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be discreet and determined at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if criminals would have to leave the country more quickly , however , increase the security and also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
the Mai@@ zi@@ ère endeav@@ ours to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag elections .
&quot; he also announced a further personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , &quot; in an average four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be under punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is to be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to remain intact after Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , as the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior was clearly opposed to action .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
the Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
a general ban on full @-@ wear is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you cannot for@@ bid all that you refuse , and I refuse wearing the bur@@ ka . &quot;
it is possible to talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter designed the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate Tat@@ a &apos;s anti @-@ terrorist act and capacity for action . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ verb@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet of Pro@@ verbs and a tigh@@ tening of the common law bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the Autobahn ( Autobahn )
it st@@ ews itself regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic at the ambient road every night in traffic , when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße , by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is spl@@ itting early , thus improving the total performance in the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended trip had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing at the train station anno@@ ys drivers above all between 17 and 19 hrs .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return traffic reaches up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h road and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the needle &apos;s eye is on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only in a narrow way via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to include heavy @-@ duty transport two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will continue , the competent national company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years can be expected : the bridge has an official remainder of rest until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the national company deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because of disability . &quot;
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and Wednesday on the construction site .
intercultural travel : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Voy@@ age &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the staging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster through this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Speech , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background have been given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Voy@@ age &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany on the night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ sho@@ ots are per@@ sei@@ des , which are among the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations with 216@@ 000 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which proceeds in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you have to wake up for hours , in the morning it is far from the alarm bells no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ze , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ef@@ or@@ cism and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands below is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ som@@ nia and in@@ som@@ nia disorder . &quot;
&quot; just passing through , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association , with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind this can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is particularly common in depression , &quot; says We@@ ze . &quot;
and it can be that different factors damp@@ en each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly start to p@@ onder@@ ing over everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily dis@@ comfort like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any sleeping medicine in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , in case of sleeping problems , you should contact your GP first , tell us . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations as to whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep lab and what happens ?
&quot; for example , for examination in the sleep lab , physicians advise physicians in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of sickness , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a deep sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ bon@@ net explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; just please do not make lunch , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling features the sleeping room . &quot;
how can affected people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of locking screws that can be used for better sleep .
&quot; suit counts on : regular sleep and rising times , don &apos;t sleep too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s all and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to have
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook about the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first picked up Gold at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ tsch has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues standing in criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € award and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 € no one should be surprised by missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , however , dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , he had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot control a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; demands the choice of ham@@ bur@@ gers who have meanwhile been conducting an ice cream . &quot;
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage Li@@ fting
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civil cases of Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years old . &quot;
&quot; as a gang , the susp@@ ects had made several bags and bags of bags . &quot;
&quot; at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants recognized in the Düsseldorf airport a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several delicacies since the mid @-@ July of this year and were involved in a joint , working , and especially professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ min@@ al Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four actions to the th@@ iev@@ es , who had been specifically submitted to Germany to commit crimes . &quot;
&quot; they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between are still a remainder of cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not appear so , but the police ranks it among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
on the facade of a grey house someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , but in recent weeks it is prefer@@ enti@@ ally illustrated by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were ev@@ acu@@ ated , pat@@ ro@@ iled the police for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground , blocked off parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearing was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the jubil@@ ee of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others talk to Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the care of rising costs and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for several local police protection against v@@ andal lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between home @-@ owners and their neighbors open up , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which today , in comparison with the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the whole Main@@ zer road quite close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and poll@@ s from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the rentals , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on designed disks or freshly painted faç@@ ades , which were disc@@ ar@@ ded with ink bags . &quot;
no other street was mentioned so often this year together with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal acts such as bodily injury , statistics are report@@ edly directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a ten@@ ement house next to the disp@@ uted 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ rd : the people in 94 are their neighbors , they are definitely not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer giving it to the R@@ ī@@ ga anymore .
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the R@@ ī@@ ga street - and remains .
&quot; that is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the plain@@ ti@@ ffs beyond the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; that is , ultimately , con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are some people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve force and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of colour bom@@ bers : the house project and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who pul@@ ls , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub @-@ area , can badly complain about noise . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; in addition , she is social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the Social Ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , Working Group Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the cutting @-@ line Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than looking at the large number of requ@@ esting tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a cutting @-@ edge wo@@ olen mil@@ der . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports adult and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers will be in the W@@ as@@ enstraße &quot;
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs for construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must be carried out by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Federal Government Office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , it didn &apos;t work , so it was necessary to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community dwell@@ ings need to be cleaned as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be set up in the W@@ as@@ enstraße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed place , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who have to be ti@@ led or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
that was &quot; not employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people need to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so it takes offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so here administration and volunteers also jump .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others to motiv@@ ate others . however , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two of the most recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear radic@@ alisation , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks will bring them completely into circulation .
&quot; they want to show that they do not have anything to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and volunteers will have to look out on the spot and in the region . &quot;
they are always in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy sh@@ es . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put it on site hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ s are already ast@@ o@@ unding to integrate the former people in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : in@@ tru@@ der wanted with helicop@@ ters
the helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - without success .
two unknown men arrived for@@ ci@@ bly at 8.@@ 50 am on Friday morning in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward journey .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , probably m@@ asked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; for the prosecution , the police set up several strip @-@ occup@@ ations as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the prosecution proce@@ eded without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown would be close to the apartment or at their escape . &quot;
