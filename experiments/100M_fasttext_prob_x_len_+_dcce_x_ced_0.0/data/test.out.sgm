<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">"CHIO:" "golden sport pyramid" "for Bernhard Langer"</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted back home to the feed-troughs in a quick gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the equestrian career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He allowed himself with his family to carry on the system of the ALRV on a horse he did not even catch up for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sporthilfe handed over the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are no awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, champions-tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting the offspring for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, der Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping runner Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps economic policy comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are unone in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep it small and cautions about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to taxed the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it will massively revert regulations, and it makes it strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the other hand, Clinton says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes for the rich would increase, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in that must be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost word-like."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical team-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, there could still be party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up the coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas, to cancel the Paris climate agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its investment programme Clinton, on the other hand, plans to extend and challenge renewable energy with its investment programme:" "a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better then, demand for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to go up, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics deem him so that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing themselves, almost daily."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously with big eyes curiously into the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-wing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs recorded the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men are fleeing because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten death or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women predominate for the escape:" many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced labor, honor murders, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodations only for them, calls for Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in shelters of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabians single-winged women are not isolated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Lower Franconia there are floors or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or will men and women be accommodated together, it can lead to - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection, can be read at the rush that there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since he has spoken about it, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily set up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistants of the assistants have called on their union to approve new work campaigns in their dispute concerning a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers failed to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistant physicians and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained" persistently "to problems, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC Management Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requested official new negotiations about all your worries."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight month long war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin picks up his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants to achieve this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile was implicated, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if never been a bad thing."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin shaming, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downfall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was spurred.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the transgression was even greater, as it was committed by a presumed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the etracker will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were allegations of senior officials, that Erdogan would have benefited their own family from illegal oil trading in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was apologizing from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after last month's failed coup d'état."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights, which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisle attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted approx. fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because of its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian head of state won a bonus for sure that after the attempted coup d" état, he demanded support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting at this glittering palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" alliance of outsiders, "two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel bad and now unite."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they had not even taken the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately interfered with a question of their differences, while Putin decided to stress it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey flowed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads consulted at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was named after his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it reads (in Russian) that he later was Chief of Staff and Head of the Head of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state with regard to the draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was going back on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president, at once wanted to lead the Russian environment policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said," "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you almost could say - to trust me for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov picked up the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin was a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by a further, obvious allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closure of the" "ceiling blower", "which approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 inclines."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation which requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the entire deck construction are in their place and the last section of the deck now gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is a trend-setting high-rise and low-rise building."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the northern lighthouse located in the expansion, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons weighs and has to be pulled upwards in an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"delicate as the tolerances, on which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building favourable apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors should be put much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 low-priced homes in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next meeting, the SPD will propose a" "Housing Concept". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban surfaces will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great conflict in the town hall is, however, that Bratmann:" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but as 20% of the apartments as social apartments as possible."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing program that will cost millions and still have to be financed should provide incentives for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, such as Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the CDU would like to make as few regulations as possible, as possible."</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of this, such as Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not entirely new: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one compensate for the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will run in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased by the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be redesigned to bring back apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem can be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the western city, the end of the year is running."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 flats you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only, they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social-dwellings in the western city is increased dramatically, the aim of the so-called mix is removed."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social inequalities in just a few parts of the city shall no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens anticipate that there will be no movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"President Holger Herlitschke said:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenager and child no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, was sued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to television, then on video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs emerged from it)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the USA, Australia and New Zealand started slightly in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pokémon, who will be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which reflect the" average "person every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the introduction of the game, the number of people followed suit every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays the Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" 30 minutes of time "to" come from the sofa, "and" be active every day, "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of getting diagnosed with cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also müritz games that always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track down our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemon success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="14">"she broke out in tears, when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end."</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:"</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnasium and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls from other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Catholic, round off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts has been an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterly gymastics routine."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but it doesn't look like sports classes in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit the same path as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but reality looks like Turns is a more expensive sport and gymnasts primarily come into private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents responsible for training, teaching, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these associations, the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started exercising."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to inspire the communities of aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible physical training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "through the Holen of the Olympic team gold and thank you, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the first assistants are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work, to improve the care for astounding times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors shared last night in a communication with:" "assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current disability crisis and will be given to meet all doctors."</seg>

<seg id="9">Jeremy Hunt has to act now to raise the penetration and address the concerns of the assistants.</seg>

<seg id="11">"the last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 deadlines, as nurses and specialists were involved in granting doctors to cover the strike."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the last two months, we spoke to the committee of the Assistant Doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, training lessons, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Culture of Political Correctness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as an annihilating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former member of the cabinet of cabinet Sir Eric Pickles implements the police, polls and town houses to ignore the need for election abuse because of" "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now an antagonist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut-off tapes outside of elective cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should take a demonstration with them, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter must merely call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable ink on the finger of a person, when giving their votes in order to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to church documents and decisions from unofficial committees or workgroups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only for election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government against the wider corruption and financial crisis that accompanies it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special selection court decided that the current mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had denounced the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical ways" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman shall have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person chooses another."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarming to the fraudulent election - when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leaders of ways to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "as evidence, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have unknowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit the mailbox to stop" "reap". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social-betting purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on the finger of a person once she has released her voice, to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="31">Photography ban in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English must be used in electoral stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees are usually enforcing voters to go alone in the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astounding" that after the Tower Hamlet's case there was no penalty.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Electoral Court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty as a result of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "check-ups" "of the Town Council's constituencies."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country wears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Parliaments, but the worrying and hidden spreading of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if one approaches you from behind, then you should turn off first so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit it with the knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker collapses before pain, the weapon becomes out of his hands. beat him with the barrel and move backwards while they set the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when attackers who approach the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and strike the attacker on your chest, then spin the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and put the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and strangeness of a serious test by hiding some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk fired his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train, as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before checking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhoker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to check the rinsing knob of a tensile toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he tasted, more than a poor aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to train stations to sinks of toilets, the task posed his immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test-line showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric quantity of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to check after their Luminometer was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film" The Lickheker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial capacity at different places such as the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this is close to the worst thing I have geroed in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will do nothing here, because it is disgusting here inside."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickheker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended us saying "Let's call Ian Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the director of the film, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I need him to lick, just like the ekelty Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to blame, and others in which this was rather difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social housing after delogation with a loss of £50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skelby and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were flaccid holes on, wooden planks were flung wide, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family was resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not so beautiful part Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had inflicted the family, attacked street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strikers and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeleton, 47, whose name stood on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which will possibly be demolished, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"they were found in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden prawns"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours promised that they saw them fighting on the street and needed to call the police on a regular basis</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogged her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation were cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They were not afraid of anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have missed the family with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police was established at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the church building, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, since delogation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">"I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours, and the message conveys that anti-social behavior is not tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers now have to wedge up garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police led a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of money after having found guilty of owning a class B drug.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeleton, who came to life in 2013 when a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will delogging lessee who don't cling to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall informed that delogation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can accept themselves without reproaches, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"in the medium term it could even be" some hundred thousand, "the former president Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because of the harsh precedent of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer-election campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid than so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and ground combat - this bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the tourists who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so are not allowed to choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end voices, just laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people over itself."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say this at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to be afraid of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sella, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as it already did his legendary wordless predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel holds the guilt on the blossoming of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We create this" "speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which probably will cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its Spitzenkandidaten, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale conferences; Merkel Parliamentary elections lie in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not vote, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is too bad for anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Northeast-CDU largely eliminates the usual electoral distances on market places and before shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this is what Kokert says, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"also, the Union noted that in the country you would leave the base that she needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the left, the SPD, the Greens, you hardly exist in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU campaigner coking on his comrades is also self-revealing:" they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffest, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD a particularly dedicated campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">S & D Group's news on the European Parliament's Plenary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, will make the leap into the land day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holidays-need and impose their election campaign largely on the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section, to see him under the pseudonym non-Allegrenic men's age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in Millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no horden by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer their emotions rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit before I stand up, hold my hands and somewhat determine how:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart Soho slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill in the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (Number of numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and ready."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend some time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my key.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, which he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, who have heard about the comeback and see how to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection since 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that plate shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some of the record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to move back to the stability of trusted records of vinyl, of objects that cheer happy jugenderings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get busy mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee instills from a stack of records."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people, who bought a record last month, have not yet listened to."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% possess a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of news report I would probably look very worried while I puzzled by a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Keys: three middle-aged men), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said:" I do not own record players, but I would like to buy a radiohead vinyl record so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-sensitive, less musiclastic."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I don't have a record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come first slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the record nearly a whole floor, has an entertaining audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz drumps out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but nailing psychic traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shovel-pewter than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting sheets is no real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record-lovers: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I feel the appearance of patterns of jeans, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group themselves for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my investigations yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record holders that exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not by cheating through disks of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who overlooks nothing clueless man of middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to offer 72 temporary shops selling cigarettes to Energydrink, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down, because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanitation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court with the fact that shops and restaurants are important, as free meals that are offered by the state-supported union and other groups, would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led to the fact that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the deportation of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas could offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the tear, was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is administratively operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" "closure" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two Relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number of survivors in the jungle increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er rugby hit the final hurdle on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the shape of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji created a master class in the handling, side-steppe, drawback, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic Gold Medal."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to it in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost almost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to marvel at the attacks of the attacks of GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau landed in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he walked around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely caught the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a stocking Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jaza Veremalua takes a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute of playing... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to the interval.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB conducted fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua Tuisova was going through a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was running for a long time in favor of the South seeinate, whose fans sang, swelled and danced on the grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first stop to the last, 220 hard pieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she drove to the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, who put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter inflicted effort, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athlets that slide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal to goose."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental progress that make the difference, and no one was more active than the trainer who was not aware 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was fortunate that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right concept under such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing on itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even larger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wrecking morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world."</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose a race over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be torn.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - View for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened by green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Federal Minister of Economy, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), remains the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition) in the release of the Renewable Energy Conversion in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that after two years we finally managed to achieve tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases coming from the blast furnace for power generation for its own consumption, to ask for the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ; there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, all an EEG levy of 20 percent is required."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on self-confidence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus the status quo of the present scheme is largely ascribed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'steel is future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others need to follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are weighed down," said IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to grow when the world's largest producer of producing China cast mass-carbon steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers launch price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, importing import duties on import-steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been suspended."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been stagnating."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, around 860,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing stirs me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"for singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of the music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular cooperation, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures are often solved in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to talk and organise to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs are not as fast as the puste in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even though it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority; it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"with lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia are relying on long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head is also asked for special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate at the same time on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially elderly people who live alone, do not just focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I have a long time for something, I become better and grow above me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears you when a sound goes wrong with it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"on the search for the appropriate offer, senior citizens have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior enchor, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, tells Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so dumb."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploded on Thursday evening in an excavation quarter of two bombs."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to police, a Thailänderin was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"then again two explosives went up early, and another man was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation in the vicinity of the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police indication."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal clerk."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air before the Revier of the Coastal Police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast as well as in Chomphe on the south-east coast called for several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said army-iron Danai Kritmethavee to journalists early in the morning. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves on possible motives, but it is probably the act of the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurrection, or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to restricted areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear what group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance safety around important governmental buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"according to the well-known bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its homepage to follow the instructions from Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its environs."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the conflict between security forces and Muslim populations, it is not necessary to travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) suffered for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday caused a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military big influence even in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to steal chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, reaffirmed itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"just a year ago, in Bangkok, there were 20 people killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became the viral Internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59th position of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was not just a sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received special startrights by the International Swimming Association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in sub-represented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as in aedics most athletes run, Habte wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames made the lap fast.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called it "Robel of the Wal."</seg>

<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest, if appropriate corrective measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a high level of calculation, the wastewater fee in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, Kulmbach District Office was established in the hometown of Kulmbach that undercover these wastewater treatment systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal basis, the market of Kasendorf is required to cover the systems cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse."</seg>

<seg id="11">"due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water supply in all three systems is slightly declining."</seg>

<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the Azendorf sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping station, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after nearly 20 years operation the first sewage treatment had to be extended, the sewage sludge has to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "these extraordinary expenses were the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water incident in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were completely smashed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unique, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All false entries come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have raised criticism in the past where they were accused of making Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, there were some critics a racist cartoon of Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy had indicated a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and the indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat saw that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was conceived as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos has been widely used, that the filter was" "vulnerable and blind". ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it's difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-backed, but that the yellow face was drawn into the outgoing extreme."</seg>

<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting for a user," so it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military members of the United States Central Command changed post-intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot, reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the republican members of the Armed Forces, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-related information, typically sent down by high-level CentCom agencies, regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism, as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, opinions and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts, the report noted."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom handicap publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the points of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom are underway due to the General Inspector of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence agencies on ISIL and the Iraqi security services, the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff, delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaging the morals among analysts "and" gave excessively little space for different opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention at the CentCom analysts regarding a "determined political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "The Daily Beast". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by the Pentagon's general inspector, which were recorded after complaints by CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspectorate were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also assumed that" experts at times have divergent opinions in interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful aerial campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest reviews of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of the divisions of more than ten years ago when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker confirms that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, the team had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this knowledge, however, was not published, reported the Times in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"CentCom's damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">"the United States wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK before"</seg>
<seg id="2">"one day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons on the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will achieve the first and second place within their group from six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the first-placed will take a little longer from the Dutch, who will lead the other group."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as usual, the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans released a surprising fuss because of their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time she had a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better place."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," "said Bam."</seg>
<seg id="17">"we did not have the workspace in London, which we now have."</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the cake ring in the first half of the game with a backlash from the seam area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she executed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and flawed the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guidance."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling consistent and inevitable, a raging relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wrist protection to the swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympics and a women's swarm with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names being sent to Prime Time, if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic tramp."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally recognized: gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the Breast swimming and may have a long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparingly perceived that many that I had interviewed did not know that it is an olympic sport at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it never won a medal in jumping on the trampolines and had an athlete from 2012 until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a Earth-bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of the gymnasium and the diving, the two sports that essentially unifies it."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El rebounder which means "trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling motions (turning, Hreal and Saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, you will be judged according to the execution, level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also in television broadcasts a further undermining goal: that of the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented effort is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a viewer to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find myself to be a bit tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she jumps down, seemingly heavier like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, but the dreamy, elegant liquidation of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attunement and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested a short time ago, Mr. Dooley expects his air rinse, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia, met with the government's violent resistance."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunfights.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed on dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Commission is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the Horn of Africa by the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia has been anything but an example for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the repression by the government, the opposition in the country has been limited, where dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Sevim Tesla, a lecturer in central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control over 100 per cent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists, such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years were more or less forced to use turmoil and could be rearmed."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of wording under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amperas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas who come from Ethiopia mainly prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a Oromos leader. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unambiguous reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia experienced such turmoil in 2005, after thousands were protesting against elections which, according to the statistics of analysts, pledged to be pledged by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in recent months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal disputation of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, controlled by Tigray, attacked and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently concluded that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the" founder "of the Islamic State's terrorist group."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, asserting statements which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump hurried back to the claim on Thursday and insisted on suggesting that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the allegation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate didn't want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leaks down on Mr. Trump while trying to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he thought the Russians were to chop Mrs. Clintons's emails, but he later declared" "Of course I meant the sarcastic." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" "clarify" "depending on how the reaction expires." "said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump accepted an etched tone, as his readings went further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leadership with a big advantage in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally tempted to not excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or understand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while reinforcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps's scissors have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had formed the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backseats, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton acted as the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by taking control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of leaning on each of his words and being biased against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he scorned the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't. ""</seg>

<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs last book" "Chop Suey" "was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a home at the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the latest collaboration," An decent meal, "which will be published on Tuesday in Harper Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop, a small, beatiful Imbiss at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter asked Hackenschmidt, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, Leberkäse and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been in the stomach as lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>

<seg id="21">"it was the Americans, who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the ways in which the country would end up being no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>

<seg id="23">"just as tense was the new budget diet: mysterious food such as bread and casseroles became staple food, the casserole as a" wonderful way to recycle food leftover, "" noted Ziegelman, since quiche could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest whirlwind is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Clan: [LLJK] Postings: 1927</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation on board ship Sanna, this shark was allowed to return to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks have only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark swiftly floats along the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of 1.220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by loneliness, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "in any case from a Greenland-shark, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist has long argued that Greenland-sharks become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks, researchers know correspondingly little."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her slow motion pushes her, when she broadcasted six animals with a transmitter before Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"prey make this shark nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and seek carcasses that are tortured from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now studying 28 Greenland sharks, which catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Spitzbergen as a bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of eye lens is already created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens-core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons seeking larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal in the length of 220 centimeters, the lentil, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenses, which result from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the increase obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methane problems live above all in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the present record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so, later they mature - and they age slower."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of the mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner shaved last night in the male team Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor part, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he came home to win a victory from the Favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy got the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after they held in March at the London World Championships in London, despite the Hoys retreat only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a sign up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in which they stayed, when they saw potential in the gravel that has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Kenny - who won Hoy - and Skinner four years ago won a Olympic chord in the qualification rounds, but in the standarround the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"one lap after his lap, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner stopped."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that followed in a higher gear to slow it down, and to enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindem, when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It's a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympiarekord and defeated the World Champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the Triumph of 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, there was a hint that after a weak start he obviously dropped off on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I just enjoy this for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win on your own.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest performance in four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they came to the destination in 3: 51,942."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had contested with the qualification before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong team of train to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a string of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, drama played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbingvortices as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operators terminate the energy supply contract and thereby abolish all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A sub-convention for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, since the smelting consumes around 10 percent of the entire generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," the company shared. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continues to say that the contracts should be so-called" "hedging", "which should have come into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL expects that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "said the electricity supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already registered in its annual closing in the amount of $187 million in" "anticipation of a cancellation". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said the decision to book the treaties, the" ability Alcoas... to operate the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the melt. ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a statement guilty of why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually will consume around 600 megawatts and tomago some 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan's Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this Covers brought me to weeping," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"revealing the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), sung reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz onkels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). they all have planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché story of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that is rather similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the edition pulls a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Antique's 615 pages advertisement)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of his cover star is expected to be expected to seep pictures of the magazine before the official announcement in the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities who modeln "as" models, the celebrities are "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar-Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls under the previous category, it is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if none of these applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenny's success does not like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague gigi Hadid criticised her and called her "the mistlettes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled up again when the message came out with the show Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around on the missmut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite palpable."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory at the beginning was eight megabytes, which would today range for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>

<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 communicator arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into the business - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for some Euro fans can buy the devices on the internet, but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hanover as an "office in the Westerbottle format."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrow, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will be able to create 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement Heathrow is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in natural growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once invoked conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a Sun, which was 30 percent weaker."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus intensifies its day-length of the Sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun warms."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are some degrees colder than those of the earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions of years --was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as its Hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which, as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other starcores, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="7">They are now turning to the quickest.</seg>

<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solutions required by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackout software according to the observations of malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to be preset ransom is considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," says Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most maleater programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the blackout software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months alaringly fast."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for unlong modified files such as Word-, Excel- or Database files as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals had already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute by the loss of akefulness."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: does not pay, you only promote the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decode sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"considering the potential high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you have to wake up for hours, in the morning it is far from the alarm bells no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weze, member of the board of the German Society for Schlaeforcism and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands below is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia and insomnia disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just passing through, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association, with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind this can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is particularly common in depression," says Weze. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors dampen each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly start to pondering over everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily discomfort like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any sleeping medicine in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, in case of sleeping problems, you should contact your GP first, tell us."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations as to whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for examination in the sleep lab, physicians advise physicians in case of snoring with respiratory sufferers, in case of sickness, for sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a deep sleep disturbance, Fibonnet explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just please do not make lunch," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera at the ceiling features the sleeping room."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can affected people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of locking screws that can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"suit counts on: regular sleep and rising times, don't sleep too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's all and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, in between are still a remainder of cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not appear so, but the police ranks it among the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="3">On the facade of a grey house someone "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, but in recent weeks it is preferentially illustrated by burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Innensator Henkel recorded several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-Go Zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were evacuated, patroiled the police for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, blocked off parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearing was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the jubilee of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others talk to Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there are a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the care of rising costs and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for several local police protection against vandal leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police between home-owners and their neighbors open up, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which today, in comparison with the rest of the city, has a low average income and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the whole Mainzer road quite close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and polls from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on designed disks or freshly painted façades, which were discarded with ink bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often this year together with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal acts such as bodily injury, statistics are reportedly directed almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the criminal offences make property damage, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a tenement house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weird: the people in 94 are their neighbors, they are definitely not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer giving it to the Rīga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here, one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rīga street - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the plaintiffs beyond the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"that is, ultimately, condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are some people who are not so well contaminated," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot approve force and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of colour bombers: the house project and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a cutting-edge woolen milder."</seg>
<seg id="10">"administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports adult and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new containers will be in the Wasenstraße"</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be carried out by the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Federal Government Office to the Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it didn't work, so it was necessary to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, community dwellings need to be cleaned as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed place, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who have to be tiled or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">That was "not employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so it takes offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here administration and volunteers also jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others to motivate others. however, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two of the most recent occurrences fear radicalisation, also in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says quite clearly "what some people may call naive." a residual risk could and would not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks will bring them completely into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they do not have anything to do with it," Regine customer says. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and volunteers will have to look out on the spot and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy shes."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put it on site helpers."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urs are already astounding to integrate the former people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
