Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal promoted by Obama around the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partially considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor has served to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cut on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who conducted two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Offic@@ e@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call some@@ time thereafter .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police cr@@ ackl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , which compelled students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both instruc@@ ted in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic route to employment as a Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
these are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Mississi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ ships Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met with common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar play some years ago . &quot;
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
&quot; O &apos; St@@ een said , his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on night 5 . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the edge of the edge and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ cher@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call pra@@ ises Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plans to recru@@ it less labor force for the holiday season
&quot; toys R Us states that there are not so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products traders say that he will give the currently employed workers and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it tar@@ pau@@ lin to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 there were still 4@@ 5,000 workers employed . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business is getting closer and businesses are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated g@@ utter and an arm @-@ length of it to be with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really true for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time journey film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie the@@ aters in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will make violence and misery for millions of people only worse . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader calls for once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; made this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria which they have shown in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Demand values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during poll@@ s down , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some start asking themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts point out that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom none of whom even won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps through per@@ sever@@ ance and start letting their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary period :
&quot; tr@@ um@@ ps , any@@ thei@@ st , have turned 180 degrees . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans looked positively the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; when he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps tem@@ per as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters think that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters adapt themselves to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their teachings , Republi@@ can voters keep plat@@ former for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination by just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters can look at Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Republi@@ can accum@@ ulates for another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical header @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is the majority support . &quot;
&quot; ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally to Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support tr@@ ump , say they have given their votes firmly . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that and no one can really say never change the opinion . &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; immigrants from Mexico , immigration was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic pr@@ on@@ unciation of tr@@ ump @-@ critical His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and destroy the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l from Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently also do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also fur@@ ious in Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish@@ ly anno@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
the most expensive residential complex is located here - with a view over the North Sea resort .
in the street one square meter of a floor roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sylt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros , nothing - per square meter , well @-@ known . &quot;
but well who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : here , Munich is not at the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a supreme triumph of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze submitted a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the wit@@ ch@@ craft of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their inau@@ g@@ ural game in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) deser@@ ved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth stage success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot in Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; Müller was rewarded with his 28 hits in the Champions League for the B@@ awar@@ ia lead by Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had passed a shot of the World Champion as a fl@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm was promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without having to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went courage@@ ously , but often too un@@ imagin@@ able to work with their aggressive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced by reloc@@ ation at left @-@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than he hit his fl@@ ank from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Pole &apos;s head ball ( 26th ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct sampling , the Tor@@ wart Roberto served with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set needle @-@ sticks . &quot;
&quot; on door@@ ke@@ epers , Manuel Neu@@ er was lost . &quot;
&quot; for example , when he saw a shot von Ide@@ ye about the l@@ aces ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ at@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero has only given green light after the final workout , &quot; &quot; said Motorsport Director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; the Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller placed one on it . &quot;
it was at Kra@@ w@@ allen &apos;s stadium in front of the game .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mu@@ til@@ ated Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block evi@@ dently had prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pi@@ raeus through words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with cl@@ ashes against the Munich @-@ based supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
&quot; who smoke , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the good news : when reno@@ unc@@ ing the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , writing the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment again falls to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; stated bach@@ el@@ ors H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our knowledge also leads to good dental health up to the age of old age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental pl@@ ung@@ ing has been affected by DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study protects the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble across the banks of Cologne on rem@@ n@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Monum@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists have now been found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it has already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman died at the train station in Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by recording the train , she carried serious injuries from the Bundes@@ poli@@ zei ( Bundes@@ poli@@ zei &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ poli@@ zei &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by rescue staff .
&quot; on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman , there are no evidence to the cler@@ ical civil servants . &quot;
the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private lighting institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way respects more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; stated Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de has proposed to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to be created with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings demonstrate con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the United States choose independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is provided . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against judgment .
&quot; so far , the proceedings concerned themselves with each other on refer@@ ees , and there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens don &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she plans to work on an international investment court in accordance with its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , also resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) , especially of large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel judicial system , which allows companies to make claims of damage to tax@@ pay@@ ers , stal@@ ac@@ ate national laws or to en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
it was particularly critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission considered essential points for the reform of federal government ministers Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans by Malm@@ ström .
&quot; the European business association &quot; &quot; Business@@ Europe warned &quot; &quot; to restrict the pi@@ v@@ age of the economy by too many new rules . &quot;
&quot; as a result , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , continued on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne prime club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d real fol@@ k@@ singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story through various places , which he always records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they arose and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; kl@@ ug composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at all times you can drift into the great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of an abandoned series : each of the 50 States states should be ob@@ s@@ essed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine area already &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; appeared and breaks positive certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the show . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Conc@@ ise &quot; ) , a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot;
superior to ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic passages . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried out by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long ago the smaller clubs kick@@ ed off , the stage shows here are the colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
&quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band . &quot;
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; although here nearly 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the more mature St@@ ev@@ ens turns back to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can basically disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only added to an enc@@ ore is St@@ ev@@ ens modest , plays acoustic few older songs and finally bows up with thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns will be anticip@@ ating sus@@ pen@@ se when making the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and , for the first time , set up with David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to let her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , for it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commemor@@ ative ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of Shadow Ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they conven@@ ed on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour movement , namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour Ch@@ anges in order to remove the whole idea of limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pension minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is a T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says that he has &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 inspir@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Isl@@ ington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire is too con@@ front@@ al , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; &quot; strike @-@ skill &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with hooks , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea into discussion that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and demanded far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

the Po@@ und rises by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the Po@@ und burst nicely into data showing an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the quick@@ est and advanced assessment of the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the Po@@ und climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after receiving the offer of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
&quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climbed 5 % , after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports control company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the chief of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labour costs for his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to a potato dum@@ my idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
&quot; both - and in the m@@ ashed potato , developed by the Oldenburg I@@ mb@@ al owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement Al@@ h@@ ay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of the D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen in television at random . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile made the Lebanese bear in the patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility models . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y it . &quot;
&quot; only as much : &quot; it tastes better together even better , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; even with its customers , the culinary understanding of the international will be good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cash launches ground@@ breaking campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground breakdown campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; distributors and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as iron manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A shops and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A retail stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut away twelve months after opening its first markets roughly five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose $ 360 million per year and met@@ e@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and £ 600 million in each market .
&quot; loss in food and food business , and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around € 13 million before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , pays off and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equ@@ alize prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to deliver IG@@ A retailers in order to improve their stores by fast growing fresh food and to deliver a better choice of private label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ enko &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programs are to be set up and hopes that , for the first time in four years , the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves praise from the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was brought into the lim@@ el@@ ight by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp@@ f van@@ ished a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I got quite excited is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drag@@ ged a little into the quar@@ rel , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he broke a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost a r@@ ack@@ et in the US Open , but he is not the first player to vom@@ it a r@@ ack@@ et of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s trained hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to avoid Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Nick has quickly made the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs out in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the best for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and cur@@ led the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to flee illeg@@ ally into the country . everything aiming to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip along the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults to the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some people returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; to return migrants from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU countries would take another 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes in a bal@@ eful action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to get out of the crisis , enabling them to shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ lined that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison guards in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were deployed . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; but Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the forthcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , into a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the parliament still needs to agree to the military deployment , which is expected next week , but Repor@@ ter of Associ@@ ated Press has already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come here by humili@@ ating the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential election , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant to their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are only 5 points behind . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under the age of 50 has disappeared , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the pri@@ mar@@ ies nation@@ ally say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the Can@@ didate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pri@@ mar@@ ies say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question are asked why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it &apos;s time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the feasi@@ bility are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president offers a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the pri@@ mar@@ ies are asked who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for nomin@@ ating the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead will be raised ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in competition to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the issue of what is more important for a candidate , Democr@@ at voters ask questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er of the pres@@ election was unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results in some important tra@@ its in voters of the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters don &apos;t think that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pres@@ election generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server are still pending during the term as foreign minister , most democr@@ ats of the pres@@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had even deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voting rights do not keep them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters throughout the country see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes in leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut out hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many do not believe him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 local voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is drawing near Donald Tr@@ ump in the country &apos;s survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support grows of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted last month before Fox News debate , 27 % in the vote on Tuesday . &quot;
Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ rendered tr@@ ump among republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who dropped below 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % in the third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 individuals of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son climbs within the surveys - he gains 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the plat@@ former with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of a Car@@ son ascending in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s belief in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bath@@ ur@@ lau@@ bers to present even warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more to go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; bath temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even rises to up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood were charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a multi @-@ channel ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an suits against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; finally Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he dropped un@@ conscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide uten@@ sil and set the good of the Brotherhood above the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning at his injuries .
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report den@@ g was added repeatedly with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies since 1970 at the chic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ es &apos;s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
one County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment because of Mor@@ des third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for illegal attacks and formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked their belonging to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a tribute comes , and the house will be thrown down , loans for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only minor instructions on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months following the initial interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore representatives of the Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
&quot; here , a look at historic trends is based on how some areas of the economy might respond : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that capital yields can be stran@@ gled between 12 and 24 months after the first raise , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is mostly in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent compared to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tends to appear later in the increase cycle and the return on the stock begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate the recession . &quot;
&quot; most not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point , with a c@@ inn@@ ate raise of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 rate increases since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP grew below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; whether this is different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made a tribute to the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increases cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights are quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a decline in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease in the cycle occurs .
&quot; at the end of the increases cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bor@@ rowing , and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve . &quot;
&quot; bond issues often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , credit tension has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse since a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure equity @-@ games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings might see gains from higher earnings , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that only The Br@@ its im@@ itated
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , says a leading member of the Parliament and ex@@ al@@ ts new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something which the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ enced &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontan@@ eously named examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Manager rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I will not learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works , I consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience when it did this in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport fell under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Jud@@ ge - was produced in a special BBC @-@ way .
&quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it is the next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future , or to distribute the fee payments for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales rose in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into Spirit cities . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only show seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales @-@ pack . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth will be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decl@@ ining sales . &quot;
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases from this event held last Friday in November .
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers paid off their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites over@@ threw . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a British Retail Con@@ sortium ( British Retail Con@@ sortium ) found that out of £ 5 a little bit more than 1 £ was spent online .

&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Ben Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane fell
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane belonged to Mek@@ kas &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to declare their respect , when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession moved on to the sanctuary , where only days before a building crane fell by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the praying . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king had left a sanc@@ tion about the construction company of Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which left also 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 stun@@ ers who were killed when a crane crashing through the Great Central mos@@ que Mek@@ kas were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane under@@ pinn@@ ed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ad in the Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ad will go on to Mec@@ ca , with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the bin Laden group would not have let the arm of the crane become ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble when he was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service does not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a large mos@@ que courtyard where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of the H@@ add@@ ad who later takes place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group has not issued statements about the collapse of the Cran@@ s , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal decree also imp@@ acted the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project run by the bin Laden group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been linked to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dig@@ ni@@ fied son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials announced that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
others will receive half of this amount .

&quot; it is said that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you can be sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you apparently belong to a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; British increasingly employ handic@@ raf@@ ts@@ men to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Baum@@ Ann chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services to low prices has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops offering professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are taken by women . &quot;
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends , showing more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the head of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and turnover , after the group tr@@ acked the costs for closing the stores . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up to 200 new stores . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
&quot; on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion . &quot;
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; in May , he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the def@@ endants in the years from 2006 to 2011 were eligible for funding from club accounts over which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ en@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the alleg@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was not constituted at any time an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would have applied only expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , the passi@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing before the situation : &quot; &quot; do we continue the club or ban we ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread job , told the large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have spent money to lay down our life insur@@ ances as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to be made public . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of appropriate financial success , the payment of the expenses reimbur@@ sement until 1991 has been determined . &quot;
&quot; therefore I have paid off some of the expenses only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump sum and non @-@ detailed accounts also appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in the attention to the financial bore , if only the freedom of debt had been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against one of the function@@ ary investigations on account of official abuse , an amount of € 120,000 was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that had been appropri@@ ations , the accused said . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was based on the name of the second accused , and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
&quot; then he finally thought , he believed that this was the best for the society . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed himself in the room . &quot;
&quot; the compl@@ ain@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this bank transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; compensation claim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , wanted Jud@@ ge and Prosec@@ utor to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any harm . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the function@@ ary said that he had never obtained a cent salary , he only calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not indicate the def@@ endants .
&quot; they were no longer kept in store after a business test , in which everything was judged correctly . &quot;
mil@@ eage also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; in his statement , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the cost of $ 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) will be saved on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs running for three years has not yet been completed . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : break of Viol@@ ence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian Border

&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials were first replacing pep@@ per@@ al spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US not@@ ebook comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may possibly leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less harsh outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
&quot; death penalty at Delta State University ap@@ ologi@@ zed for &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues on the day and killed - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called the emergency number about 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , I have shot and killed a man . &quot;
&quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre , that the police needed to send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but he &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not exist . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday night when police killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs conception . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she was married approximately seven years ago as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ce worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that I called up relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was awarded a doc@@ torate at Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his c@@ ousin gave up on the university &apos;s website . &quot;

all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 managers around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
but there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ lig@@ atory Euro wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some € 500 million per year , resulting from cost and profit syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the board for the passenger &apos;s business . &quot;
Euro@@ wings &apos;s low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ aud will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the board team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with this new job , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , representing three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in Tari@@ ff conflict with the pilots association cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the planned strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this divided the union .
the topic of the talks shall be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; Cock@@ pit wool &quot; &quot; will come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is show@@ casing flights to the Group &apos;s own line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double Fra@@ ktur of his right bass at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside def@@ ender to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double bone structure and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ metre .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ alise the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank all of you for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with defeat at PS@@ V

&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about doing so . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ ou@@ ling of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a child care system provider to name his favorite child &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , decided Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to read my children , as it always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead recre@@ ates an ingredient of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to enrich the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who had not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing @-@ street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s elec@@ tive office .
&quot; Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s employees , but there were no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England @-@ Test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their own best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test drummer gets to put his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England was first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , whom I highly appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave mos@@ ques adjacent to Cook , which would provide an extra Spin Bow@@ ler and receive four Qu@@ icks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he emerged as op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
he made three hundred of us immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners lifting their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est fel@@ lows of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh breeze , even if the messages are in line with the said above . &quot;

&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not define the schedule . &quot;

such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could gain a supply if the economy gets into a flu@@ ff until 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced new ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought viol@@ ently for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from own guilt , Britain &apos;s own created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who looking out to Britain outside the EU @-@ T@@ ent , wishes - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted minister and civil servants have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we are staying or going . &quot;
&quot; German cau@@ ti@@ ously pru@@ dent ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long har@@ rowing like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will break down a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the value of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press area , as they did during the refer@@ endu@@ ms inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , but which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name for a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; in all his cra@@ z@@ iness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone h@@ acking foreign nation@@ als and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners , most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about her , but realized that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better spread ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ ms , because Bl@@ air had set the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never denied it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to forgive me any more - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake back then and now . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe - I just press it out - in development .
he says we should stay in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wild jung@@ les of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein Engl@@ ish@@ men can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their judgement on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the presentation dum@@ b for a matter of course as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ial Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities in Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be bound to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a power steering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I rec@@ alled at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , launched Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expected that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to demonstrate their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes company , but not the financing that he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ c@@ ig@@ ar champ@@ ions , some of which also include an industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line was also attended by p@@ he at the meeting .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; adm@@ its &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies on his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative risks compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people annually die on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking does cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear presentation of current proof that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking we comply with our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ enders , former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to make the type of programs , which are not sent by other UK channels . &quot;
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time @-@ windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least rely on programs that do not make or commission others . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I would like to see how this should be publicly @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give again what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Con@@ gart teaching in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ enders would sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ischen programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they are fulfilling their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their seemingly holy missions for justification of 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I call you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this .
&quot; of course you think everyone thinks that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called on the BBC to check her &quot; &quot; Rei@@ th@@ ian mission &quot; , &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only a little of the BBC @-@ production would now officially be class@@ ed as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain the public broadcasting channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and to make alli@@ ances with commercial sentim@@ ents to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified ne@@ ural systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard .
&quot; impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m channels that respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this topic : read researchers and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , cardiac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that elimin@@ ates electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat Parkinson &apos;s disease symptoms . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Hal@@ as@@ ani noticed that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultr@@ asonic to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; however , a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stations and in the subway trains and which require a second look . &quot;
&quot; important announcement : from September 15th to 18th with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into an image of a tank . &quot;
&quot; in September , a flock of arms traders will travel with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help at the stop of the cease @-@ fire fair . &quot;
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Ban@@ sys dis@@ mal@@ and .
&quot; a collective called Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ pack of Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stations on the planet is gaining momentum . &quot;

many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade @-@ posters greet the commuters in the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ nesty video has been viewed more than 100.000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit@@ ably with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who also works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished at the silence that prev@@ ailed around the advertising for the tru@@ ce fair - by a Le@@ ading of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ous corporate advertising , but &quot; through the blin@@ ds with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a progression of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegal in front of our front door .
&quot; perhaps the most creative art around the tru@@ ce fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors shi@@ ver fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot;

eight Gold Rules for Life in Student Residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ leg@@ ged complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to w@@ add@@ ling : people tell where you come from and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film night locations and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people are dressed and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll @-@ culture , which is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ rade of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking on .
apro@@ pos ank@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship by baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the peak of the back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping if you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chick@@ ens is a th@@ ief , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced approach than my ro@@ ommate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise that keeps people off from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my corridor asked her neighbors if they make up a bit qui@@ eter , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be aby@@ sm@@ al embarrass@@ ing if you consider a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse to divor@@ ce her , dis@@ connect and then watch her every day and perhaps witness how she withdraw@@ s all common friends over her ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; at the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his key in his not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good place is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but t@@ ack your poss@@ essions on the ceiling not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ persons , low @-@ income &quot;
&quot; the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner expands in the Francon@@ ian Eck@@ ental row houses for people , who do not have much money . &quot;
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a quite ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ lis : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; this is different , if you put people in blocks of residence . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ lis : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ lis : &quot; &quot; legally I have with@@ drawn my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated makes it always the threatening D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the setting @-@ up regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terrac@@ ed house needs at least three places . &quot;
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
Gil@@ lis : there were those who accused me of creating lux@@ uries for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true is : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that hardly could afford one more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother alone or the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s all about it .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the locking of the updates , and it will be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is close to a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may turn on half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the update . &quot;

Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consultations , we can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office has recently been opened there .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , we immediately receive senior and advice @-@ seeking information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing services . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established ourselves with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are an infinite number of questions .
&quot; the new land@@ lady Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ est@@ ead and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus , &quot; are not rarely understood . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore one can use additional offers such as risk prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are ideally compl@@ em@@ enting .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; described Heike R@@ ie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both executives see particularly in demographic change . &quot;
&quot; for this , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual city districts of Bamberg is essential in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club &apos;s opening : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular soci@@ able appl@@ ause . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings as possible .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon . &quot;

&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna Architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus wrote on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the artist haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was in the des@@ patch . &quot;
&quot; born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after World War II . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freel@@ ance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;

men checked on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are seeking the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mu@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mu@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old German , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ ets , he first left his victim . &quot;
the injured young man was now brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car to their home and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured came in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
&quot; taking a beating stick , one checked on the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a v@@ ague object description is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed in a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
&quot; Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel , Fel@@ gen@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors are missing - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of Fel@@ sh@@ ausen on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel , Fel@@ gen@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will remain with half a place for his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12th , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing their expertise in the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel , Fel@@ sh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the E@@ hep@@ aar Müller liked the idea of conducting their own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so we agreed that the gar@@ bage cans bought the house with practice .
&quot; however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up there , followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a head doctor in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz ( Di@@ ep@@ holz district ) and is engaged in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ readiness fragments of ten@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice is being prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gen@@ ausen as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( boarding ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house doctors . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ related EK@@ Gs and need a subscri@@ ber room .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ P is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 euros will receive the gar@@ bage in the framework of a conveyor programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the congregation ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice will continue , &quot; says Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2,000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ sh@@ ausen every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . in the north @-@ German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor was found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , those who visit gar@@ bage @-@ workshops still look above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the cliff . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ arewell termin@@ ates an era in As@@ endorf , after all the doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly they already sens@@ ed after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ ly@@ or and will surely see many patients quite often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter site . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed me with gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also taken up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum request , can also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; be able to do so . &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to travel to Austria and Germany coming to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to prevent Slovenia &apos;s borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees would have attempted already in the night hours to Tuesday to pass over in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , polic@@ ing vehicles with new refugees have been taking place in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country will reck@@ on with some 4000 refugees , &quot; said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , conver@@ ging Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it is the way people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , at any rate in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day additional buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had travelled the whole night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia throughout the night .
&quot; we heard Hungary made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; wide @-@ ranging possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , had previously emphasized that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testi@@ fied about what concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm down the debate on alternative routes between refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , it would not be a very high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or any other country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps of refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;

insi@@ der transactions on the financial markets should have been made with the information obtained .
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators got a total of more than $ 100 million . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately tr@@ apped , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 additional charges in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted out both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice assistance Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a busy operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people carry out their concerns , sometimes fast stri@@ des , sometimes pleasantly bum@@ bling . &quot;
they operate the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ on at the parking place .
keep the city rail@@ ways .
&quot; puls@@ ating , spr@@ ing@@ ful life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four big panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid brought attention to her 20th anniversary with this action and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice assistance is available to the pass@@ ers as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteer staff .
&quot; while some of the pass@@ ers spontan@@ eously intervene to chal@@ k and read the phrase &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffering &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ onal Plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ Federation sponsor of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public effective promotion is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to share publicly with the tables , however , is understandable , after all it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has helped many people to open . &quot;

the death and mour@@ ning anim@@ ator belongs to the honorary members of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid was seeking volunteers , she immediately reported and was part of the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid is able to deal well with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; I see the life of another war@@ rior , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and super@@ visions of the mort@@ g@@ - and mour@@ ning @-@ accompanying .
trainings for new employees are offered every two years .
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex results mixed , financial perspectives for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered his winning review for a year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. used to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and 10@@ ,90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid earnings if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday jobs were announced one day later than that of the ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to set 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share and just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share which predicted T@@ acks Investment Research &apos;s twelve analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six analysts asked analysts expected to expect 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought revenue in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results from Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result dropped because of higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares declined by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at one end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story sitting hall there is a m@@ ural in the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the pre @-@ si@@ ghted F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of the percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself sec@@ ures the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently survey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of increasing . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists sof@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value rose by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is maintaining the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a zinc increase would so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; before a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be needed , an increase of the proposition would expect . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , while the Dow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ s , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. emergency bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the effects on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the global economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , which is why it should not be involved in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for We@@ alth Management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acker , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates a tribute of interest , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives did undo these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a difficult crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the latest tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a tribute , because the markets are getting upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not think that it should be ahead of time . &quot;
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the warehouse / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / store is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the walks . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shopping mall makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the cooking @-@ kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the c@@ ac@@ ups and has different taking options .
what &apos;s there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even fry on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer compartment . here you can find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ al , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef and g@@ all , pigs , fish , local saus@@ ages , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here one : restaurant owner and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The original .
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Sk@@ ills Sh@@ ort@@ age and Over@@ education
more and more refugees are coming to Germany for these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a lot of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 lessons .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at the Dill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is considered to be at the right school . &quot;
Brazilian pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women on how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should take . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy child &apos;s diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ h@@ ens@@ bau at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent community meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Panel had submitted an application to a &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; of the valid cultivation plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof roof &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof panel for solar installations : &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; in turn was about the roof slope , which for energetic reasons - different from the plan plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan with respect to the roof slope , no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally negoti@@ ates with liber@@ ating proposals rather restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a community project of the community and of SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected by the promotion of school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the council office for testing . &quot;
Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; they see the surprising plans of the District Hospital of the county , confirmed by the Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this regard to the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be postpon@@ ed on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in every case , for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means an &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ emaker and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the In@@ ner Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until then the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , if the current refurb@@ ishment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ scar@@ city , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an occasion does not happen again , &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who was received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as head physician for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in the past decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the palms of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener used a painful defeat on the B@@ HC and made some dirty things there . &quot;

two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the ab@@ err@@ ation on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were used , as the police divided . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to the young people and threw their cor@@ p@@ ses into a canal at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the Prosec@@ ution and the police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be actively suspected and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning , after she had not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the evening . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators first bite on the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrest gave to the authorities in police inter@@ rog@@ ation that killed 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead . &quot;
the further investigation will take place on the near@@ er circumstances .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; social housing association &quot; association .
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the ten@@ ants .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is pushing for a housing deficit , which will increase from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units have already been missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in a not@@ ated state in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the floo@@ ds on the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a in the past years has declined again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives for housing construction should be boo@@ sted . &quot;
this could be wai@@ ved on the under@@ value tax and the corn@@ erst@@ ones for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats are subject to limited availability .
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia turn a corridor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that transit across Slovenia to the North without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the sealing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to travel from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television broadcast RT@@ L . &quot;
&quot; on the eve of the day , Hungary closed its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , are making ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary . &quot;
Croatia wants to allow refugees to happen .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic ple@@ aded : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
&quot; most tribal media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;

&quot; for this , the border strip boasts other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 uns@@ killed people .
shortly before the closing on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws rank the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 pen@@ al proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees could have stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a prospect to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be depor@@ ted there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it . &quot;
they gathered the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the land@@ ings in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; the 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities . &quot;
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy on Sunday with the edge of the bridge when ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly left the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ aired the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we made the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N meeting . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from a ICE into a regional train in Wels on Sunday evening in Wels to Pass@@ au , in order to try it after the short notice that railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still over the border . &quot;
the regional train was depos@@ ited at the Inn before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge festival combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a second bridge - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to build structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened the position of the Hungarian government in the midst of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted in the border areas with cha@@ otic states . &quot;
&quot; even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the sustained influ@@ x of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ resistant quar@@ ant@@ ries &quot;
Konrad has all hands full to do with the flood of refugees .
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great vor@@ tex , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad calcul@@ ates with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ts in the he@@ ur@@ ry year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , more than 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without floor , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor of the country .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create districts for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria , it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; in the morning , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also sets high expectations in the ORF &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we &quot; &quot; ORF action . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of an emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to hold a certain height of the towel rail or the size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; must apply for a temporary period of time . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , Konrad is founded with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ ve power is its most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to pay , as they explained themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
&quot; up to now , the search for arti@@ llery was not yet successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; first , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like the tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned can currently not be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the President of the Republic of Belarus spoke to the Government of the Republic of Congo . &quot;
also other areas must make their contribution here .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has taken on Monday the further action in the issue of refugees . &quot;
&quot; for me , Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off . &quot;
the further immigration of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
&quot; however , the protective @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria is also carrying out controls at its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is integrated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er wants to say : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old bear@@ er of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has grown gain in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the store in which they are sold among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I &apos;ve been wondering if I &apos;m going to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; for me , most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many woman wearing a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional lady cannot answer with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit .
the T@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
&quot; this property also connects people with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become the U.S. President . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the presidential election is stir@@ ring vigor@@ ously to the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts well with it .
&quot; this is also registered in the hom@@ etown of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker , with the hair @-@ hair @-@ hair@@ style , is a term many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot;
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to it over -@@ nin@@ ety corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , among which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz is among them . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to a word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit a fool , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dently the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The T@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the len@@ ders , says it . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz were at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was dump@@ ed without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked claims of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter il@@ licit immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ite , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more dist@@ anced to the American , &quot; &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family at a visit ended up something for the church organ , which generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not choose the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had s@@ ages in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like he , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 child @-@ singers , also in the USA aw@@ akes the interest . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria community Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ year @-@ old village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park was awarded the award for Sustainable Tourism . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local &quot; &quot; Alpine Club &quot; &quot; is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a reserve .

&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the board did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise reported an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 viewers at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , today , a slight increase in rates for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap for Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August Today , Today attracted 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise has seen an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recent we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 viewers . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour amounted to 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will vote N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar Minute which couldn &apos;t convince Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood lands in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood firmly sealed his lips to the fin@@ als on Thursday
&quot; all three women have ly@@ rical reasons why wood is the perfect man and has his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should preserve W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game spo@@ ilers become , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly recognized both of them - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood shared a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and notic@@ ing Sam@@ s energies , I sens@@ ed that they were pretty compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that wood &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when asked , when Wood had to choose , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams sending inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne selected the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost an angel , as the Aus@@ sie rug@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t did on Tuesday at his first p@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference . &quot;
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and to take care of the next game .
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings . &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian coun@@ tenance was hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a more bad start to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass was in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free voters are demanding the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; at the beginning of the FW issue in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students , &quot; &quot; We need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get obj@@ ections in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Sunday section of the Free voters is conven@@ ed until Friday in the Frank@@ ish Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters &quot; meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum is over@@ laid , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN @-@ protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the war in Yugoslavia during the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it does not go on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ boss critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need unified federal standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing long @-@ term tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , the minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Inter@@ medi@@ ate plus , &quot; with which an extension of the school @-@ based secondary school will be tested from three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW chief . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ons that want it .
&quot; free travel at the G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

4 People killed after police shooting police shooting on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , guiding district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of them throwing stones and bombs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used tear gas and then pushed into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber missi@@ les , known to be able to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ lad@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and civil servants have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alization of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently running .
&quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mix of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said by the city . &quot;
which investor demand is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner of Great Street , already purchased a few months ago and leave the building on it . &quot;
P@@ ieve project : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday village on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several tra@@ ilers are more concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
&quot; for months it was negotiated , sal@@ uted , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday village on the small sea are near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized emblem of the &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s municipal development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the Project Cri@@ tics and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went into the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
&quot; for months , this project has been in discussion for some ten to twelve million Euros . &quot;
&quot; violent reactions among hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e owners , who came to the meeting , called forth the pictures and new details about the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bus@@ tier owner and board member in the representation of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also feared like several other project critics that the traffic would increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all the bus@@ loads must come to calculate that , &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the one hect@@ are large area of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first , we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches a dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ dies . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when revealing the donation request on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google colleague , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / refuge@@ fied to 11 million dollars .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many flee from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for obes@@ e diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery that wrote a journal to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and stomach tu@@ b@@ ular formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I of those who under@@ went this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease wor@@ sen@@ ed completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes has been completely dissolved in only one percent and in part with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c &apos;s blood glucose level which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the head researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also yiel@@ ded average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ omy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 to 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefits of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people interested in BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that currently takes attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ lance writer has grown up in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that in the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must reflect on how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in sei@@ z@@ ure of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lows strongly alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zing agents , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of inf@@ ect@@ ants for children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants visi@@ bly , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how adolescents dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing m@@ outh@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t have missed a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hand san@@ iti@@ zer at school , was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah told her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ on inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as a substance . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students from the fourth grade in New York State decided to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; the police viewed the iced plan as &quot; &quot; fate &quot; &quot; and instruc@@ ted disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles are damaged
&quot; in a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and On Her@@ tha , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was easily injured during a rear @-@ end accident . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove across the cross @-@ section towards the industrial area and realised it was too late that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about had stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; as a result , he spr@@ inkl@@ ed with his truck into the rear of an audience and pushed this car onto a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; the accident of about 10,000 euros was created at the accident @-@ taking vehicles . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was dism@@ issed by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football d@@ ots the Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you are talking about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who is now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we need to continue .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful in January @-@ transfers

&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said , &quot; The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it increases in the United Kingdom altogether . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people working for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; later today , except in case of a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , there is a mak@@ ab@@ ier lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , he will watch it emotion@@ less . &quot;
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the course of the months with calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try remin@@ ding me of all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; have phr@@ ased it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to mention all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong probability exists that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man after wet police pursu@@ its persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police official , trying to &quot; gently &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ nick@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins , offering an unforgettable example . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired natives to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat down for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to move around , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I am doing with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;ll be called - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves on their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it is personal ?
&quot; did the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner , and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the troubled Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race schedule rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or tone had been applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday .
but it also had it on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this affair was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver &apos;s flight arrested

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals because of alleg@@ ations of ring fighting back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has been critic@@ ising the tac@@ kling of his players as &apos; Agenda Set@@ ting &apos; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ sting comment to the Storm @-@ Team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; during the tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the critics of two leading trainers in his team make him feel confident , because they worried they were worried about being struck by the storm team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring@@ ing when they told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has yiel@@ ded the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm beat R@@ oo@@ sters higher than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are p@@ auses , and do not have points of something exciting ? &quot;
for me it is the maps .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that in one phase we will still meet them . &quot;
the Storm @-@ Team is free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drugs &quot;
&quot; a man , possibly a life @-@ long sentence threat@@ ens to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly lifel@@ ong penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ lu@@ ent statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c has been released against deposit , under the conditions that he withdraw@@ s his Australian and Serbian passport , which regi@@ sters daily at the police and keeps himself at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab is breaking apart
&quot; on Tuesday evening , a truck driver was severely injured when a vehicle accident involving three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked ahead of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
the cab of the accident @-@ caus@@ er collap@@ sed completely .

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when she slept , went into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of inf@@ ant pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately im@@ pover@@ ished her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police looked at them and saw the five pictures , then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ research , &quot; which used concepts for the search for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; educ@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee of Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer were conducted by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was at trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls , who looked much younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in accordance with the act of indictment , to inc@@ ite un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before court hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was admitted before the date of judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( public days from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest premier@@ es for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important Astra for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel offers a start @-@ up of the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , which will start at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ essi@@ a offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variation will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be driving on new compact cars next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra Competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;

Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ publisher wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;

the launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely re@@ done is the compact car model DS 4 which is visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the out@@ sides , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ le had a hand on the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary @-@ pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , who was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to them , those affected can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated from space . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who is now on the open foot according to his lawyer &apos;s information has been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his de@@ priv@@ ation of his office due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the state of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Jud@@ ges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re @-@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation are decisive , be a compensation claim , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; would be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus they spoke only in April of a prisoner in@@ dem@@ nity , because he was locked in a cell naked . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision by 2011 , man @-@ un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for over three months , the plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have had the head@@ lines due to lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to h@@ unters it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the judi@@ ci@@ ary press , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of lack of growth , 19 should fall away . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated firmly in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we are creating that .
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different forecasts , between 350,000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially for affordable rental objects : annually 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; a lot too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social @-@ dwell@@ ings per year need to be created and for this , the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; the work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the company society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from work ban to refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a work ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the view of the labour market has also been established in several ways that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the building of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is first of all very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sto@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nonetheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of hand@@ bills is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity for training - for example by allowing more technical colleges . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared in classes for teaching . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees are willing to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ates the study - the only exception has been Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
prepar@@ atory refugees could be made easier access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a period of stay or de@@ priv@@ ation , no services after the asylum seek@@ er authority do not receive any more if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually swe@@ ep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state of religions . &quot;
the establishment of an Islamic welfare union that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally would also be important .
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear partners and be ready to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes readiness to take heed of religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be a topic for the whole society today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender Equality Act for a decade .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racial motive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants and stakeholders of non @-@ white German need for a long time and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany have to become a reality in the next few years , if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the good of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding man@@ power and capacity , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all newcom@@ ers , demands to be handed out immediately during registration of health cards . &quot;
performed services could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the Länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to travel so many people with the limited power catalogue which the asylum seek@@ er law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are above all doing the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would need to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already been helped with more general medical care centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in the case of refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ dealt with disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures German doctors come from their training , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors is even allevi@@ ation in sight by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly leave examinations again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill based on estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sych@@ otherap@@ ist ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; eu@@ c @-@ k@@ r ( Korean ) g@@ b@@ 23@@ 12 ( Chinese , simplified ) g@@ b@@ 180@@ 30 ( Chinese , simplified ) &quot;
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is being traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and fear of death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleeping and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z stated . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ically sick asylum seek@@ ers can apply for a psych@@ otherapy application in the Social Off@@ ices , however , it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social @-@ offices , there are mostly non @-@ specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide if a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst loads into the man@@ ege on the brick up to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; &quot; passion &quot; - under this motto , is the current stage of the estate . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift to spiritu@@ ell is the family in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with world city flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov c@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in its spell . &quot;
the Castillo brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily take up . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast shall win women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with flair and joint integrity . &quot;
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
fascinated and sc@@ aring at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little other and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; stresses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at her position as well : &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sten &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read off by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to fall into the arena . &quot;
so the highest commandment is good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Zim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had boy@@ cot@@ ted him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones , which warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; death , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament is ending and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ person said that the party managed by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard becomes up to 30.000 work@@ stations
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and service activities .
&quot; the expected job reductions will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide and expanded portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a statement by the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage you have called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to manage the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the light of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs , who recorded most of the vulner@@ ability days . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability ratio will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win martial strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to go forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 play after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured at the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco , and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ o@@ al triumph with his management . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the absence of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desp@@ aired than ever has ever become , how suicide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the man &apos;s year aimed at asking the people to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noticed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to show strong , life @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality the insulation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the best thing with friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ug@@ s , moments when playing soccer in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely relate to them , even if they often lag behind to completely explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of telep@@ hon@@ ic pastoral care I told me : &quot; &quot; my listeners role for people who are de@@ pressed and vulnerable , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might help people in moments of despair as well as long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the scenery completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k with . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the complete 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria meets PS@@ G to help mal@@ ign , Malm@@ ö &quot;
angel Di Maria is celebrating Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will meet PS@@ G passing by Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the stadium grounds on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion into the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion since they are not only seeking the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . later he was replaced with his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 ounce on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ storm was called the man who was able to take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , which hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ gli@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ th minute they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ p@@ auses and bad shut@@ downs , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who lost in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he took his te@@ amm@@ ers in the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shoot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er scored his sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left side of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö is able to return to the game , and only an excellent grasp of Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
since then we only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the Quali@@ fication Games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , who is affected by mining raw materials prices , gathered a share of 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday as part of its huge debt reduction plan . &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ enc@@ ore company , registered in London , said in an explanation that it has sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , fights with falling commodity prices , because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn is pushing demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the head of the London Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
firm of the Year for Distribution and Fran@@ ch@@ ising Os@@ borne Clar@@ ke Firm of the Year for Employment Fresh@@ fields Bruck@@ haus Der@@ inger Firm of the Year for Insurance Nor@@ ton Rose Ful@@ bright
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent reduction on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; on Tuesday , 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a usually long run . &quot;
&quot; the refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;
the youngest offspring is a six month old girl from Syria .
the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confir@@ ming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on September 25 , and President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan to a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks .
&quot; President xis Visit will give the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , will probably meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi addressed a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;
440 @-@ PS @-@ Sports@@ cars borrow@@ ed and crashed to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to fulfil a dream and gave himself a Ford Must@@ ang .
on the left motorway then the evil awakening came .
&quot; with a company in the county of Got@@ ha , one can dream of the dream and once again hire a V8 US sports car Ford Must@@ ang Boss 302 with 440 b@@ hp . &quot;
so this was also a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the county of Got@@ ha .
&quot; on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream was then out and over . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got into the ch@@ and@@ elier at n@@ asser &apos;s road@@ way and drove to the control plan . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured . &quot;
&quot; the property damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; obviously a few years ago the FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champions League winner , two times club champion , twice European champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old now left FC Barcelona and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship before the f@@ arewell to Barcelona .
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in memory : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ana was the reason X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi states , why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken over Guardi@@ ola and I played a great CAP . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the Red Army split ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal class triumph at the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , experienced actor Brown broke out when she emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it at the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . wow , &quot; when the comments of the actor discovered by The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People made up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said , &quot; &quot; At the end , their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its variety - that &apos;s SO NO@@ TE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ ons comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Movement launched nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against co@@ existence . &quot;
in February the singer Prince introduced a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowned first champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ ber and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition @-@ show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could close all the steps of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the fin@@ als , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten up to the final . &quot;
&quot; to the last task , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 or alive , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E. about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he was upset about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for a second season , shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ - The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ asted a chance to climb inside one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return to the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said tiger manager Brad Stam@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to focus completely in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the beating wood well , &quot; &quot; said Kornil@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the punch training , saw clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three laps at the end of the seventh round , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton concluded the inning with a double on the left field .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy ran a wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie pot@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finale run , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the major league leading in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe kick@@ ed off a double play
&quot; when Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the c@@ aller of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ wing Dut@@ ch@@ man stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pitch for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the injury list after having been missing more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and sens@@ ed that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes issued a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers placed in the second one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a huge blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ drag , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP will strike Daniel Morris from the vulner@@ ability list to fight the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
&quot; since August 20 , he has been absent for a err@@ ing on the right hip . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the inv@@ oked people should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden in the evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sport halls of the H@@ essi@@ an provincial capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , according to the government pres@@ idency of the government . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria is an option
&quot; the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states &quot; collective om@@ nis@@ ci@@ ence . &quot;
four years ago one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said at Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again set up controls at its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , but no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann filed a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new trial on the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the Länder in the first time and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this in cooperation with the countries , and on the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , confess this too . &quot;
&quot; but who does not have a lead perspective , can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view has been sub@@ divided into the round .
&quot; the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole had to cope with a &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asion over Romania - Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , there were thousands of migrants in Turkey on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
&quot; room son@@ de &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot;
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ ells .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so the moon will melt easily on its path around the ring planets .
&quot; although it is only small but too big for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
even longer it was known that under the ice blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; so , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers at that time closed . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
&quot; around a month in 1860 München , Val@@ det R@@ ama has to disp@@ ense with Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot;
&quot; an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , shared the association . &quot;
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis is expected to be a four weeks break . &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper looking at the possible commitment of a non @-@ compatible pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ en@@ siv@@ mann . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ ats have the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot;
tor@@ jäger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training after his conc@@ ussion about the week .
&quot; on Thursday , the Austrian national player should start running into running training . &quot;
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was hurt by a violent coll@@ ision at the head . &quot;
&quot; in opposition to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to look for his slender line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - mainly su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them include B vitamins , vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ go contains much vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits are thus supporting tend@@ ons , immune systems and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the colour of the shell alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; however , a man@@ go gives a special touch to sav@@ ory dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , p@@ oultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS points up to $ 95@@ 000 for the Christmas business in the United States .
&quot; the company already started with recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are searched for . &quot;
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 000 aid . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be ready for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the parcel service to harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first blow @-@ tower , then stre@@ aked cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and the night for th@@ urs@@ day the fle@@ a bl@@ asts with storm strength through the fo@@ ehn valleys .
&quot; after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind bows and a temperature back . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive field of deep @-@ pressure over the British Isl@@ es in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
&quot; on the north side of the Alps , on the night , on the Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n , breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning blows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly also with over 100 km / h in the Ur@@ i country . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate as far as into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ cs of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ ks for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the alpine slope . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s rain , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air goes off , as a result , a cold front with a strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east is rolling through Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes and the temperatures fall considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south , however , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome just next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Protestant Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es were able to live only in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot;
the place is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a sin@@ ister sin @-@ be@@ ak .
his negative impressions could have reinforced him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare H@@ og@@ an Lov@@ ells
hammer artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now published with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Rudolf has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles emerged that dev@@ ote themselves to issues such as cross @-@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books . &quot;
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost on the basis of painting with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; embedded between the artist &apos;s original quotes , Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist , who formulated his own personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trig@@ gers for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant mi@@ stress Order . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing was done with the cane &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Rudolf rec@@ alls old . &quot;
I tried to re@@ vise this to bring me back to the Father &apos;s Father again .
&quot; his second concern was to help art become more important in a fast @-@ lived time : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall &quot; &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar &apos;s art has always been &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but were chosen for it important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; it was created a picture @-@ Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation , &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X rail nah@@ t
&quot; plans made , space found , companies were commissioned to model earth@@ moving for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was finished again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured it , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus , hill switched off , searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be made in October , the First Municipal Council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck will now share in the Child and Youth Committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year &apos;s still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees from 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the po@@ ign@@ ant situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there cannot be said in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must face the policy .
&quot; for this reason , the German football federation has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will enter the &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen CEO Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama of refugees is going on every day , no one can take away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football clubs , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; for the Euro @-@ qualification match against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ sbach signed the support of refugees as &quot; a large common network of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements had started in their own projects was great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government , the association will be providing 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP Managing Director loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; according to reports , Chief Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a down@@ fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after midnight on the stairs in the House of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blind@@ ed , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully functioning . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue the software group . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you please . &quot;

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : pasture f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken down . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top@@ Game against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we anticip@@ ate a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high intensity of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its parent &apos;s position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he announced a change at the door of the door . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribal @-@ keeper Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether Wei@@ den@@ af@@ eller will be used in all Europa League matches in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the German Federal Government , Germany should be technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ at IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which will also come together with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Transport Ministry &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a quick access to digital radio communication . &quot;
testing of new technology is currently underway on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and , if necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to employ around an international level to increase the per@@ missible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car acceler@@ ates the lead and the driver becomes more and more passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; have to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ politi@@ cian S@@ ören bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical about their self @-@ prop@@ elled cars - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent could be seen on the highway , at 45 per cent in traffic . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car in control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the present stand , the Düsseldorf Congress will only open in the single individual at the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Austrian trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected on Friday .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , was wearing Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of fashion scene - and that he stuck men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; it was ble@@ ak in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been held in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of man , written in fashion history , without ever having completed training . &quot;
&quot; the show is not constructed chron@@ ologically , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographer &apos;s overall artwork for which much effort was spent : to dev@@ ote pupp@@ ets , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged . &quot;
&quot; 14 tons of material , according to the Senator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , went to Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , fur@@ ious fashionable side@@ walks of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he then taught himself to disc@@ ard fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later on I bought it .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery by Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as vo@@ icing niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in great quantity for customers , for example processed for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today , this is no longer working , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styl@@ istic periods , is an increasing job potential . &quot;
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they are already half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Pl@@ auen &apos;s Pl@@ auen is a member of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® industry association and embroi@@ der@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; today , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weak , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the United States . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year , we have been running a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecological and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outer branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , high @-@ quality and innovative products have to be found . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point .
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ ff@@ les small ch@@ icks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße has been inspired : &quot; &quot; before I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who want a reminder . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ fil@@ ming but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy must open to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should advoc@@ ate to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Management Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new spin @-@ off@@ s and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the local reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it shows the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a constitutional business environment and shaping the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also stated that China border areas will allow to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; during the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part , as reported in a statement released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nerve tox@@ in .
&quot; Food@@ watch &apos;s consumer organisation , which has been a corresponding work paper for the EU , sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mistaken industrial and environmental policy are handed down with full force to pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers &quot; , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily loaded with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be sold . &quot;
&quot; according to Food@@ watch , the EU aims to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ Watch also described this as a trick , because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low loaded , that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the lowering of the cl@@ an@@ dest@@ ine is therefore a &quot; &quot; per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal for the human being highly enrich@@ ing over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; even small amounts can especially cause un@@ born damages to the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is primarily absorbed by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run out more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount consumed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , for instance in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; was quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
