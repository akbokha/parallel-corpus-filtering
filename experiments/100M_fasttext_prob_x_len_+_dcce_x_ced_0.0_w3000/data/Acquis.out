&quot; II ) summar@@ ized information on core material that is subject to securing measures according to this Convention may be published on decision of the Council and with the consent of the directly affected countries or the community , as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) In the implementation of securing measures according to this Convention , technological development is fully charged in the field of securing measures , and all efforts are undertaken to ensure the optimum cost effectiveness and the use of the principle of effective backup monitoring of the river of core material , which is subject to the use of instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points , as far as the current or future technology is possible . &quot;
&quot; B ) In order to ensure optimum cost effectiveness , the following methods are applied for example : I ) spatial f@@ ing@@ ering as a means for determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the detection methods to the phases of the fuel cycle that could be produced in the manufacture , processing , use and storage of core material , which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other core explosive material , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To effectively carry out the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention grants information on core material that is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment used to carry out the safegu@@ ards regarding this material . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on facilities are limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the application of securing measures relating to core material that is subject to the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On request of the community , the organization is ready to check investment data , which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not need to be translated materi@@ ally , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization pic@@ ks up the consent of the Community and the States for the appointment of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) abol@@ ishes the Community either against a proposed designation or at any time against a given designation , the organization of the community and the states proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if due to the repeated refusal of the Community , to appro@@ ve the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are hin@@ dered due to this agreement , the Council shall discuss the refusal after the general director of the organization - in the following as &quot; &quot; the General Director &quot; &quot; - has dealt with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually carry out the tasks ahead of them .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that the possible nu@@ is@@ ance and distur@@ b@@ ance for the Community and the States and for which peaceful nuclear activities are as small as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial sec@@ rec@@ y and other inspec@@ tors of the Organisation for the knowledge of the confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state applies vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other civil servants , the tasks according to this agreement , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with respect to core material , if the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity that is under the point of securing measures of exposure , or practically non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; the Community notices the organization according to the agreement of this Convention , the transfer of core material from the states , which is subject to the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention shall be termin@@ ated with respect to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for this . &quot;
the organisation conduc@@ ts documents from which any transfer and if necessary the re @-@ application of the securing measures to the core material will emerge .
&quot; core material that is subject to securing measures according to this Convention is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so the association with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated with respect to this agreement . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives during the duration of non @-@ use of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention .
B ) The organization and the community agree that the safegu@@ ards provided in this agreement are not applied as long as the core material is used in such activity .
&quot; in the provision , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards do not apply . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the safegu@@ ards provided in this agreement are once again applied once the core material is again fed back to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation will be held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of the material contained in the state , or the material in question , and on any transmission of such material from this state or state . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include an endor@@ sement or an under secret knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the use of the nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow from this Convention in carrying out their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or individuals that are subject to their sovereign power , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will be able to reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has been enriched in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , can be used according to its laws and other regulations , to the organisation and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim which the Community or State shall asser@@ t against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the association or the state due to damages , except for damages arising from a nuclear incident , shall be settled in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; in order to verify the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the council is not able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives , he can reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C and may also take the appropriate measures there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account which mass has been attained through the applied securing measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every justi@@ fiable occasion to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the Community and the affected state to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes regarding an as@@ cer@@ tainment of the Council in accordance with Article 19 or a measure taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled upon request of a party of an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed a fifth , who pres@@ ides over the pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators in three days after the application for an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , the Community or the Organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint this arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure shall be applied , if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal shall be competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the resolutions of the arbit@@ ration court shall be binding for the organization , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) if the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its securing measures with regard to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult one another on request of one of the contracting parties on a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all member states of the organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .

B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable when implementing the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ ards determined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the turno@@ ff of significant quantities of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for unknown purposes and the det@@ err@@ ence of such a branch through the risk of early discovery .
&quot; to reach the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting will be used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial enc@@ ro@@ achment and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the inspec@@ tions by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the material quantity that is not shown for a specified period specified for a specified period of accuracy is specified for the specified amounts . &quot;
&quot; in order to carry out their investigations , the organization in accordance with article 3 makes use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance areas .
&quot; in applying their securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and they , as far as necessary , will see how they are determined and useful in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of existing , derived , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and measuring uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) method for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
e ) method for ass@@ essing appropri@@ ations of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes in this stock , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
measures to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material mining or ore treatment .
&quot; B ) establishes ur@@ anium or th@@ ory material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , so the organization of the organization shares the amount and composition of the material , provided that it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or will this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear waste stream produced into the states , so it is subject to the other safegu@@ ards mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not permitted , the Community is temporarily not possible or desired , so consult the organization and the community via the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , provided by these safegu@@ ards as long as the entire material amount freed from this Article in the States at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of his weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should a liber@@ ated core material be processed , processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the association meets the organization of supplementary agreements that are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective establishment of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without modification of this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ up between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organization establishes a consolidated stock of the entire , the securing measures of this Convention in the States , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory of inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; ( GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Co @-@ operation , in order to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ro@@ ses problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Inter@@ action Account &quot; &quot; that will help member states in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction ; this account is managed and used by the organization as a &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; , &quot; only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction will be seg@@ mented separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the Member State , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective State at order of the organisation as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited in the organization in the respective country . &quot;
&quot; B ) the payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrative appointed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time , between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budgets . &quot;
C ) Any Member State may request payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker envis@@ ages roughly proportional scre@@ enings on the cash or the school che@@ que in order to cover expenses for the special transaction loans and compens@@ ate for the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; in gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounts ; and
VII ) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ paid development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organization funded by the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices referred to in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction cannot be used instead of regular means by the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions that apply to the organization granted for the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able for 10 years in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and can be ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this fee must be paid directly to the organization that re@@ tains them .
&quot; each special transaction loan is to be interpreted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services that are manufactured or provided . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are and that may be the recipient of a special transaction loan , according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are carried out on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be with@@ drawn from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; until full gran@@ ting of all special transactions loan , the administrator will inform the EEC on the plans and programs approved by the directors to the audit by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator noti@@ fies the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures for this . &quot;
the administrator sent the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed invo@@ icing of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the EEC will soon send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction , the amounts paid out from the account and the amounts paid to the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account , lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization may be in@@ compatible , have not entered into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the full capital amount of all special transactions recorded by the benef@@ ici@@ aries in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement will be rep@@ aid and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States noti@@ fy the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedures concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two sig@@ natures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding binding . &quot;
whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE RE@@ LA@@ SS@@ EN :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation on the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental plant , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation is named after chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research work in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; since extensive works are still carried out to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contract parties of the present agreement to summar@@ ise their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will enable every contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefits by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the research work , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve the goal of this agreement , the contractual parties are associated with their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom program &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program will take over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , which may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , this occurs in the place of the programs mentioned in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association stipul@@ ated in paragraph 1 shall be realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; in the context of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement stipul@@ ated in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and the individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom contributes to the fact that Switzerland is involved with the date of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to the Joint Company J@@ ET , whose constitution is accepted by the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland may become a contractual partner of any contract , except association agreements or other similar tre@@ aties concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies intended to carry out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Par@@ agrap@@ h 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , fores@@ ees the suspension of a steering committee , which belongs to the competent representatives of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , and to draw the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two deleg@@ ations in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; V@@ G . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has provided the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions related to the current or planned programmes and activities in the Eur@@ atom program , takes on this task with regard to all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * ability in the interests of both parties to the common objective in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss program and the common objective in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives within the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Groups , which provide the V@@ G research proposals with regard to that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and who is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , will provide this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the staff and the exchange of the same between laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the coordin@@ ating committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which have appropriate proposals for the Committee of Directors , provide the best possible use of resources , personnel , and knowledge and skills necessary to carry out the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , apply this task in the respective field with respect to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F members belong to the core and energy research representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of the future programs and the definition of their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the area of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Gover@@ ning Committee , the Advisory Groups and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the V@@ G on the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
&quot; the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is determined annually on an amount , which is in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Switzerland to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects the J@@ ET joint undertaking , which is determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , the Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom posts to finance the work that is made due to the corresponding agreements . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amounts to cover expenses as part of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned . &quot;

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on mobil@@ ising the demands of Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks make an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed until the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ ices ; this equ@@ ates to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments of member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned , for whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions to be exceeded without exceeding a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans , as well as with the extension of the loan , the BIS would calculate a loan fee commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the BIS at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who apply the BIS at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ Z has to proc@@ ure the necessary resources on the market itself , the interest rate coming to the application could achieve a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increased by Li@@ bor . &quot;

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be possible if international standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 against C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; an &quot; incomplete &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard Prepar@@ ation of the In@@ complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative approach to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um is to react with blood cells containing Do @-@ An@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object carriers according to diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , have to have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immun@@ ised by the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; therefore , these Ser@@ a are only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are bo@@ unded in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 towards c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object gir@@ ders according to diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object gir@@ ders according to diamond and ab@@ el@@ son test ( and must not contain anti @-@ D ) , if they are mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50 % in@@ undation of c@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction is not inferior to the ant@@ an@@ itary antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific group A group .
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ An@@ tigen which is called those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it does not contain human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ an@@ tigen which means those of the blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is to ti@@ ate parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative Council , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary when the same attempt with the resur@@ rec@@ ted but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard Prepar@@ ation of the Anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen which is called those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is to ti@@ tr@@ ate parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative approach , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent in@@ undation of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard Prepar@@ ation of the Anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin Ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by injection of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; if it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescri@@ ptions , it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate any un@@ laden human red blood cells , no matter which blood group they belong . &quot;

anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies are sensi@@ ti@@ zed and red blood cells that are sensi@@ ti@@ zed with the aforementioned &quot; in@@ complete cold antibodies &quot; and with t@@ ann@@ in treated red blood cells that are sensi@@ ti@@ zed with human Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and finally with 10 different specimens of un@@ laden human red blood cells with and without A and B anti@@ gens .
an anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin ser@@ um must cause a strong ag@@ glut@@ ination of red blood cells in the delivered form or in the dil@@ ution specified on the label which is loaded with human in@@ complete anti @-@ D ser@@ a with a ti@@ ter of 1 : 4 ( or less ) if the ti@@ tr@@ ation is performed using D @-@ positive blood cells after the &quot; Alb@@ um@@ in Re@@ placement &quot; method .
&quot; in the same dil@@ ution , it is necessary to ag@@ glut@@ inate the sensitive K @-@ positive human red blood cells , sensi@@ ti@@ zed with weak anti @-@ antibodies , and the sensitive red blood cells that are sensi@@ ti@@ zed with a weak anti @-@ F@@ ya antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in the same or another on the label , it must also ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells , which are sensi@@ ti@@ zed in the presence of fresh human ser@@ um with weak complementary in@@ complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for clinical use , the loading with all types of the aforementioned in@@ complete antibodies should be det@@ ectable with a single th@@ inning of the anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ Ser@@ um . &quot;
anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the seeds or other parts of a suitable plant and possibly subsequent cleansing .
&quot; the anti @-@ A re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ anti@@ gens , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it does not contain human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A re@@ agent is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative Council , separated by A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of the re@@ agent must in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
&quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary when the same attempt with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity ( ii ) . ii ) Anti @-@ B blood group re@@ agent ( veget@@ al ) &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the corresponding part of a suitable plant and , if necessary , subsequent cleansing . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ B re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen B , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen B , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B re@@ agent is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10@@ percent in@@ undation of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International Standard Prepar@@ ation of the Anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;

&quot; based on Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures , &quot; to free the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties ; &quot;
&quot; considering that for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this release falls within the competence of the community , which has been established by the Treaty , by which it was established , which has the necessary powers ; &quot;
&quot; from the time of its entry into force , this Additional Protocol is part of the Convention . from that point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all the States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection within the meaning of Article 2 and the date of entry into force of this Additional Protocol to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; in the balance that the Community adopted within the action programme to strengthen the internal market , as of 1 January 1988 , in@@ tra @-@ Community goods transport introduced a unified management paper , &quot;
&quot; in the sense that it is appropriate to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a uniform administrative regim@@ en , &quot;
&quot; in the balance , that this Convention may not be interpreted as long as the contractual parties are un@@ binding from its obligations under other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a single paper ) is used for all export and import procedures , as well as for goods transport between the contracting parties ( herein@@ after referred to as shipment procedures ) . &quot;
&quot; the distor@@ tions associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single paper , for which prints are to be used according to the patterns in Anne@@ x I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the single paper , depending on the case , serves as an application or paper to export , to dispatch or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out the statutory regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the uniform . &quot;
&quot; - are required by the parties , so that they may come to the satisfaction of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the contractual parties , simplified procedures , also using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In@@ dic@@ ated procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods in question must not be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete application may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , it is necessary to en@@ force a registration in which it can act with the approval of the competent authorities in order to be subject to peri@@ odic collective registration , within the period specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be used instead of using the paper documents . &quot;
&quot; if the entry paper is used , the parties can be included with the consent of the competent authorities for the export and import@@ ation associated with the export and import duties in the trade common lists in which the goods are described . &quot;
- to close among themselves agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the festivities for their entire goods traffic or for sub @-@ areas ;

&quot; - to allow the competent authorities to enter the data required for the provision of the respective information in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications , and if necessary without giving written application ; &quot;
&quot; - to allow the competent authorities in the event of using a data processing system for the treatment of the applications , that the export , shipping , or import notification made either by the single paper created by this system or if such a paper is not created by entering the data into the data processing plant ; &quot;
&quot; - App@@ il@@ ations , which were adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 ( 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of goods required for export , shipping and import of goods by means of a uniform are laid down in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre @-@ printing cases listed in Anne@@ x I , are to be found in Anne@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
( 1 ) The registration must be made in one of the official languages of the contracting parties authorized by the competent authorities of the country in which the local authorities are authorised to export or dispatch .
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the destination country or its representatives in this country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Sub@@ ject to paragraph 1 , the application shall always be issued in one of the official languages of the import country if they are carried out in this country by using other copies of the import or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may apply for each individual proced@@ ural period of a goods transport between the contracting parties , which may only be used in this one section of the registration exemp@@ li@@ ces , where appropriate examples may be added to them in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be associated with a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; however , the competent authorities may be exemp@@ t from the special provisions on collection programmes , however , that the conveying conditions for export and shipping procedures can be applied to one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies provided for these mort@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be convincing as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the application is included in the copies of the application . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth goods transport between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance can be refused or refuse in whole or in part , if the desired country of view is that the administrative assistance would affect its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other major interests , or to viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the assistance of the authorities , the appropriate decision and grounds of the requ@@ esting country shall be communicated in@@ viol@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which she could not afford , if she is seeking it , she points out in her request to this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention and enjoy the protection , which the domestic law of the country , which it received , is granted for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which she has issued , and subject to the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;

( 1 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee has the task of managing the Convention and to ensure its proper application .
&quot; for this purpose , the committee of contracting parties is regularly informed about practical experiences with the application of the Convention ; it speaks of recommendations and in the cases referred to paragraph 3 decisions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee appro@@ ves amendments to the App@@ endi@@ ces to the Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation stated in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Last Th@@ read . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party accepts a decision under the provision of the provisions of the constitutional requirements , the decision , provided there is no date , is in force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party applies appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this Convention , with the need to take into account that the need to be taken into account as far as possible and in applying the provisions of this Convention to bring satisfactory solutions to all @-@ sided satisfactory solutions . &quot;
( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and on the one hand and for the areas of the EF@@ TA countries on the other hand .

I allow myself to propose the following agreement that will serve as the basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Council , &quot; in order to ask recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will follow this wish as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . in view of the Commission &apos;s responsibility in questions of management of fish stocks , the Council agreed to present all relevant reports of his working groups to assess the inventory situation and the reports of his advisory board of fish@@ eries affairs . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly advise on how the cooperation between the two parties can be intensi@@ fied , and in particular investigate the opportunities presented by the Commission to establish a closer link to the Council of F@@ ish@@ eries Committee . &quot;
&quot; 4 . at the signing of this agreement , the Community will pay a total of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ k@@ r and pay yearly payments . &quot;
&quot; the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings , which are conven@@ ed at the special request of the Commission . &quot;
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties are re @-@ examined . &quot;
&quot; unless new provisions are agreed , the agreement extends on the basis of existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
any party at any time has the cru@@ el@@ ty to res@@ ign from the agreement with a period of notice .

the contractual parties DI@@ ES@@ ES convention that has been worked out under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the Council for cooperation in the territory of the Zoll@@ amt -
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to facilitate the understanding , comparing and evaluating statistical data , especially those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce costs resulting from the fact that in international trade goods goods have to be re @-@ defined and re @-@ co@@ ded in the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the unification of trade documents and the transfer of data , &quot;
&quot; in the sense that the development of the technology and the structures of international trade necess@@ it@@ ates significant changes to the Brussels Agreement from December 15 , 1950 on the customs tari@@ ff scheme for the entry of the goods into tari@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE level that the level of differentiation required by governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is presently far beyond that which is contained in the plant to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in the balance , that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; weighing , that the harmon@@ ised system should be used for freight rates and transport statistics of various modes of transport ; &quot;
&quot; as far as possible , the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included in the systems used in the trade for the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; in the balance that the harmon@@ ised system should contribute to a close relationship between the import and export markets , on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN DER FOR@@ v@@ eg@@ ulation that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ized system and the International Trade Directory for the foreign trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations should be maintained , &quot;
&quot; weighing that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff and statistical literature , which is appropri@@ ated for use by international trade partners , &quot;
recogni@@ zing that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of the technology and the structures of international trade ;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for cooperation in the territory of the Zoll@@ amt , the Committee for the Harmon@@ ised System has done in this field . &quot;
&quot; although the aforementioned agreement on customs tari@@ ff scheme has proved to be an effective tool to achieve some of these goals , the conclusion of a new international agreement is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired outcome - &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods , &quot; in the following &quot; harmon@@ ised system , &quot; consists of positions and sub@@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from the notes to the sections . chapters and sub@@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ized system ; &quot;

the contracting parties of the agreement signed in Brussels on 15 December 1950 on the establishment of a Council for Cooperation in the territory of the Cust@@ oms Service
&quot; it is desirable that the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System , concluded on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the Harmon@@ ised System for the term and enco@@ ding of the goods , entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the balance , that without a change in Article 13 of the stated Convention of the time of entry into force of the Convention , this Convention would remain in@@ secure - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention , concluded on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and enco@@ ding of the goods , in the following &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; , &quot; paragraph 1 receives the following version : &quot;
